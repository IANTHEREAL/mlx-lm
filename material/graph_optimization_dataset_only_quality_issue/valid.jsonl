It supports real-time data replication by capturing changes from TiDB transaction logs and replicating them using protocols such as Canal-JSON, Avro, and open-protocol. TiCDC is recommended as an alternative to TiDB Binlog starting from TiDB v7.5.0, offering improvements in memory consumption, alarm rules, redo log performance, and compatibility with Canal-JSON. It addresses several bugs related to schema handling, TiKV client resource maintenance, meta data cleanup, and prewrite event handling.\\n\\nTiCDC supports sending incremental data to Kafka in Avro format, dispatching data to different Kafka topics by table, and replicating charset=GBK tables starting from TiDB 6.1.0. It also supports SASL GSSAPI authentication types for secure data transmission. Additionally, TiCDC can be deployed on Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, utilizing Persistent Volumes (PVs) for storage. The tool is manageable via `cdc cli` and supports TLS starting from v4.0.3 with a default server port of 8301 when deployed through TiDB Operator.\\n\\nKey features include high availability through PD's etcd, data consistency using tidb_external_ts, support for multiple downstream platforms, and the ability to skip DDL statements for table attributes. It also supports batch UPDATE DML statements and is incompatible with `IMPORT INTO`. It is recommended to use TiCDC with `sql_require_primary_key` enabled.\\n\\nTiCDC includes a tool in TiDB 4.0.13 that implements processor flow control to avoid memory overflow and supports cleaning up stale temporary files. A significant change is the deprecation of `--sort-Dir` in the `cdc cli changefeed` command; users should now set `--sort-Dir` in the `cdc server` command. Before v4.0.3, when restoring tables using BR, it's crucial to add tables to the block list using the `filter.rules` configuration to prevent unexpected DDL executions on the restored tables.\\n\\nLimitations include issues with multi-valued indexes before v6.6.0 and DDL operations within imported SQL statements.\"}, {'id': 660151, 'name': 'TiDB Cluster', 'description': \"A distributed NewSQL database system designed for high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery.

This operation aims to optimize performance, improve storage efficiency, and enhance query speed by reducing the number of regions that need to be accessed. It is particularly useful after operations like dropping or truncating large amounts of data, which can leave behind many empty or small regions. By default enabled since TiDB v3.0, Region Merge triggers writing in-memory pessimistic locks to disk and replicates them to other replicas. However, it can also be controlled through the merge_option attribute, allowing administrators to set it to 'allow' or 'deny' as needed. The feature addresses issues like slow query performance post-deletion and handles scenarios involving large numbers of empty regions. While Region Merge offers significant benefits, it is not without risks; potential issues include panics and unexpected peer destruction if the target region is invalid or if the target peer is replaced with a destroyed peer.

Monitoring and diagnostics are facilitated by tools like Grafana + Prometheus and commands such as 'tiup diag collect ${cluster-name}'. The cluster supports high availability, strong consistency, horizontal scalability, and bidirectional replication via TiCDC.

It handles data storage and retrieval, stores data in a key-value format, and manages data in units called Regions. TiKV also supports multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and interacts with TiDB Server via key-value operations. It is responsible for storing both data and metadata, and it replicates data to other components like TiFlash for analytical processing. TiKV is capable of handling hundreds of TBs of data in a cluster size of up to 200 nodes. It supports JSON log format, improved write speed, reduced disk space usage, and provides ordered traversal based on key order. TiKV also addresses various bug fixes and improvements, such as preventing reconnections, optimizing writes, and supporting encryption at rest using algorithms like SM4. Additionally, it supports batch Region split command and empty split command to improve split performance.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n2. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph.

Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer.
