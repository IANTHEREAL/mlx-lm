Secondary indexes are distinct from the primary key index and can be created on one or more columns using the CREATE INDEX statement. They can be queried using the SHOW INDEXES statement. Although they speed up queries, they can slow down write operations and consume additional storage space.

It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

It is compatible with MySQL and supports various deployment options including cloud-based (TiDB Cloud Serverless, TiDB Cloud Dedicated) and self-managed solutions. The cluster consists of several core components such as TiDB, TiKV, PD, TiFlash, TiProxy, Prometheus, Grafana, TiCDC, Pump, Drainer, TiKV Importer, and TiDB Lightning. Communication between components is secured via TLS encryption, and data restoration can be performed using full backups combined with binlog backups through the Reparo tool. Monitoring and diagnostics are facilitated by tools like Grafana + Prometheus and commands such as 'tiup diag collect ${cluster-name}'. The cluster supports high availability, strong consistency, horizontal scalability, and bidirectional replication via TiCDC.

It represents a contiguous range of key-alue pairs and serves as a logical division of data, similar to a shard or partition in other databases. Regions are distributed among multiple TiKV instances to facilitate data distribution, fault tolerance, and high availability. They are managed by the Placement Driver (PD) and can be dynamically split or merged to balance load, improve performance, and manage data distribution across the cluster. Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data. Before Follower Read was enabled, only the leader node of a Region could handle read requests.

It supports real-time data replication by capturing changes from TiDB transaction logs and replicating them using protocols such as Canal-JSON, Avro, and open-protocol. TiCDC is recommended as an alternative to TiDB Binlog starting from TiDB v7.5.0, offering improvements in memory consumption, alarm rules, redo log performance, and compatibility with Canal-JSON.

Binlogs are used by DM-workers to manage data migration, determining starting points and re-parsing ranges as needed.

It supports real-time data replication by capturing changes from TiDB transaction logs and replicating them using protocols such as Canal-JSON, Avro, and open-protocol. TiCDC is recommended as an alternative to TiDB Binlog starting from TiDB v7.5.0, offering improvements in memory consumption, alarm rules, redo log performance, and compatibility with Canal-JSON. It addresses several bugs related to schema handling, TiKV client resource maintenance, meta data cleanup, and prewrite event handling.\\n\\nTiCDC supports sending incremental data to Kafka in Avro format, dispatching data to different Kafka topics by table, and replicating charset=GBK tables starting from TiDB 6.1.0. It also supports SASL GSSAPI authentication types for secure data transmission. Additionally, TiCDC can be deployed on Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, utilizing Persistent Volumes (PVs) for storage. The tool is manageable via `cdc cli` and supports TLS starting from v4.0.3 with a default server port of 8301 when deployed through TiDB Operator.\\n\\nKey features include high availability through PD's etcd, data consistency using tidb_external_ts, support for multiple downstream platforms, and the ability to skip DDL statements for table attributes. It also supports batch UPDATE DML statements and is incompatible with `IMPORT INTO`.

TiFlash supports various query optimizations, including data compaction, distinct optimization, and spilling intermediate data to disk. It is compatible with TiDB and TiSpark, and its performance can be tuned via system variables. TiFlash is recommended for isolating OLAP workloads from OLTP workloads, providing physical isolation on the storage layer and consistent reads. It supports multi-disk deployment and can execute window functions, joins, and aggregations efficiently.

It analyzes SQL queries, considering factors such as table statistics, indexes, available resources, and optimizer hints (e.g., LEADING). The optimizer determines the most efficient way to execute queries by evaluating costs and selecting optimal execution strategies. It handles memory limits when building scan ranges, employs techniques like partition pruning based on the WHERE clause, and can derive TopN or Limit operators from window functions. The optimizer's behavior is influenced by system parameters such as `tidb_enforce_mpp`, `tidb_opt_prefer_range_scan`, and others, ensuring queries are executed as efficiently as possible. In TiDB v8.0.0, the query optimizer has been enhanced to better support multi-valued indexes, collecting statistics on these indexes for execution plan decisions and creating Index Merge plans for OR conditions with 'member of'. Additionally, it estimates subquery result set sizes and determines appropriate join algorithms, selecting physical implementations based on data statistics to achieve the lowest overall cost.

By executing computations on the storage layer, it minimizes data transfer over the network and improves query performance. It handles vector calculations, expressions, and processes requests, including features like scan range statistics. The Coprocessor also addresses issues related to stale data, preventing the return of stale data when removing a Raft peer, and fixes issues such as panics caused by large response sizes exceeding 4 GiB and timeouts during request processing. It executes operations such as TableFullScan and StreamAgg, allowing TiDB to push down computation logic to the storage layer for processing within each Region, offloading processing from TiDB and enabling data processing closer to the storage layer.

It handles data storage and retrieval, stores data in a key-value format, and manages data in units called Regions. TiKV also supports multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and interacts with TiDB Server via key-value operations. It is responsible for storing both data and metadata, and it replicates data to other components like TiFlash for analytical processing. TiKV is capable of handling hundreds of TBs of data in a cluster size of up to 200 nodes. It supports JSON log format, improved write speed, reduced disk space usage, and provides ordered traversal based on key order. TiKV also addresses various bug fixes and improvements, such as preventing reconnections, optimizing writes, and supporting encryption at rest using algorithms like SM4. Additionally, it supports batch Region split command and empty split command to improve split performance. Furthermore, TiKV includes a bug fix related to the ttl-check-poll-interval configuration issue and utilizes compression, which affects the output of JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(), impacting compatibility with MySQL.\"}, {'id': 39064, 'name': 'Slow Store Detection', 'description': 'Algorithm for detecting slow stores in TiKV, improved sensitivity and reduced false-positive rate.'}, {'id': 2948, 'name': 'ddl_slow_threshold', 'description': 'Log DDL operations whose execution time exceeds the threshold value.'}, {'id': 363257, 'name': 'TiDB Cloud', 'description': 'A fully managed, cloud-based version of the TiDB database offered as a service.

The feature addresses issues like slow query performance post-deletion and handles scenarios involving large numbers of empty regions. While Region Merge offers significant benefits, it is not without risks; potential issues include panics and unexpected peer destruction if the target region is invalid or if the target peer is replaced with a destroyed peer.

It supports real-time data replication by capturing changes from TiDB transaction logs and replicating them using protocols such as Canal-JSON, Avro, and open-protocol. TiCDC is recommended as an alternative to TiDB Binlog starting from TiDB v7.5.0, offering improvements in memory consumption, alarm rules, redo log performance, and compatibility with Canal-JSON. It addresses several bugs related to schema handling, TiKV client resource maintenance, meta data cleanup, and prewrite event handling.\\n\\nTiCDC supports sending incremental data to Kafka in Avro format, dispatching data to different Kafka topics by table, and replicating charset=GBK tables starting from TiDB 6.1.0. It also supports SASL GSSAPI authentication types for secure data transmission. Additionally, TiCDC can be deployed on Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, utilizing Persistent Volumes (PVs) for storage. The tool is manageable via `cdc cli` and supports TLS starting from v4.0.3 with a default server port of 8301 when deployed through TiDB Operator.\\n\\nKey features include high availability through PD's etcd, data consistency using tidb_external_ts, support for multiple downstream platforms, and the ability to skip DDL statements for table attributes. It also supports batch UPDATE DML statements and is incompatible with `IMPORT INTO`. It is recommended to use TiCDC with `sql_require_primary_key` enabled.\\n\\nTiCDC includes a tool in TiDB 4.0.13 that implements processor flow control to avoid memory overflow and supports cleaning up stale temporary files. A significant change is the deprecation of `--sort-Dir` in the `cdc cli changefeed` command; users should now set `--sort-Dir` in the `cdc server` command. Before v4.0.3, when restoring tables using BR, it's crucial to add tables to the block list using the `filter.rules` configuration to prevent unexpected DDL executions on the restored tables.\\n\\nLimitations include issues with multi-valued indexes before v6.6.0 and DDL operations within imported SQL statements.\"}, {'id': 361409, 'name': 'TiCDC', 'description': 'TiCDC is a change data capture (CDC) tool within the TiDB ecosystem.

It is horizontally scalable and uses the MySQL protocol for client interactions.\\n\\nThe TiDB server maintains several in-memory tables, including `CLIENT_ERRORS_SUMMARY_BY_HOST`, `CLIENT_ERRORS_ SUMMARY_BY_USER`, and others, which track client errors and provide monitoring information. It also handles client connections and returns errors and warnings via the MySQL server protocol.\\n\\nThe server includes improvements such as Proxy Protocol support, enhanced monitoring metrics and logs, configuration file validation, TiDB parameter information via HTTP API, batch mode Lock resolution for faster garbage collection, multi-threaded garbage collection, and TLS support. It can be connected to via JDBC by TiSpark and optionally verified using a trusted certificate.\\n\\nEach TiDB server maintains its own cache of AUTO_INCREMENT values, allocated in batches (default 30,000). Interleaved cache requests across multiple servers can cause gaps in the sequence. Restarting a server clears its AUTO_INCREMENT cache, potentially leading to value exhaustion and loss of client error summaries stored in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CLIENT_ERRORS_SUMMARY_GLOBAL`.\\n\\nThe TiDB server has undergone several improvements and fixes, including faster request failures, added virtual tables for profiling, fixed issues with the `kill` command for pessimistic locking, removed unnecessary rollbacks for single-key transactions, panic fixes for empty responses during Region splitting, reduced backoff on PessimisticLock errors, and modified configuration check behavior to print warnings for unrecognized options.'}, {'id': 49333, 'name': 'Best Practices for Using HAProxy in TiDB', 'description': 'A document providing best practices for using HAProxy with TiDB.'}], 'relationships': [{'id': 2602, 'relationship': 'TiDB Server can use HAProxy for load balancing.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/tidb-architecture', 'source_entity': {'id': 720114, 'name': 'TiDB Server'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 900148, 'name': 'HAProxy'}}, {'id': 46807, 'relationship': 'The document describes best practices for using HAProxy with TiDB.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/benchmark-sysbench-v5.3.0-vs-v5.2.2', 'source_entity': {'id': 49333, 'name': 'Best Practices for Using HAProxy in TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 900148, 'name': 'HAProxy'}}]}", "answer": "<issue>\nreasoning: The entity \"Best Practices for Using HAProxy in TiDB\" (id: 49333) has a vague description that simply states \"A document providing best practices for using HAProxy with TiDB.\" This description lacks specificity about what best practices are covered, their importance, or any key recommendations contained in the document.

It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS. It also serves as a source database for data migration, including utilities like mysql_tzinfo_to_sql for loading time zone information, which may encounter errors such as 'Error 1298: Unknown or incorrect time zone: 'UTC'' if time zone data isn't properly loaded.\"}, {'id': 47984, 'name': 'Database Privileges', 'description': 'Permissions granted to a user to access and perform actions on specific databases.'}], 'relationships': [{'id': 51027, 'relationship': 'The SHOW DATABASES statement is used to view databases.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-create-database', 'source_entity': {'id': 660035, 'name': 'Database'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 480048, 'name': 'SHOW DATABASES statement'}}, {'id': 41480, 'relationship': 'Disconnected sessions can be caused by network connectivity issues.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-5.4.2', 'source_entity': {'id': 43468, 'name': 'Disconnected session'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 43467, 'name': 'Network connectivity issue'}}, {'id': 66919, 'relationship': 'CREATE DATABASE is used to create new databases that can be listed by SHOW DATABASES.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-statement-show-databases', 'source_entity': {'id': 362581, 'name': 'SHOW DATABASES'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 47988, 'name': 'CREATE DATABASE'}}, {'id': 53877, 'relationship': 'Only one of the PD instances actually runs TiDB Dashboard.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dashboard-ops-reverse-proxy', 'source_entity': {'id': 510050, 'name': 'TiDB Dashboard'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 360905, 'name': 'PD Instance'}}, {'id': 66917, 'relationship': \"TiDB's SHOW DATABASES statement is designed to be compatible with MySQL's behavior.\", 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-statement-show-databases', 'source_entity': {'id': 362581, 'name': 'SHOW DATABASES'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 66908, 'relationship': 'SHOW DATABASES displays only databases the user has privileges to access.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-statement-show-databases', 'source_entity': {'id': 362581, 'name': 'SHOW DATABASES'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 47984, 'name': 'Database Privileges'}}]}", "answer": "<issue>\nreasoning: The entities \"SHOW DATABASES statement\" (id: 480048) and \"SHOW DATABASES\" (id: 362581) represent the same SQL command.

It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported.

Partition pruning is applied based on the partition type and expression, and writing is supported with utf8mb4_bin collation. Optimized memory usage and performance during analyze operations are key features. In TiDB, partitioned tables improve query performance, manageability, and availability by allowing operations on smaller parts of the table. They enhance query speed, particularly for operations like TRUNCATE and DROP, and support features such as backup and restore. However, certain operations, like column type modification and adding partitions when cached, are unsupported. Partitioning can lead to excessively large data chunks during export using Dumpling and may cause unexpected issues, such as inconsistent data indexes and incorrect results in certain scenarios. Partitions can be defined using schemes such as range or hash partitioning, and they allow for efficient data loading, deletion, and management. Restrictions exist when adding unique indexes to partitioned tables, especially if they have primary or unique keys.

It represents a contiguous range of key-alue pairs and serves as a logical division of data, similar to a shard or partition in other databases. Regions are distributed among multiple TiKV instances to facilitate data distribution, fault tolerance, and high availability. They are managed by the Placement Driver (PD) and can be dynamically split or merged to balance load, improve performance, and manage data distribution across the cluster. Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data.

These partitions can be based on specified criteria such as range or hash partitioning. TiSpark supports reading and writing range and hash partitioned tables with certain restrictions on partition expressions. Partition pruning is applied based on the partition type and expression, and writing is supported with utf8mb4_bin collation. Optimized memory usage and performance during analyze operations are key features. In TiDB, partitioned tables improve query performance, manageability, and availability by allowing operations on smaller parts of the table. They enhance query speed, particularly for operations like TRUNCATE and DROP, and support features such as backup and restore. However, certain operations, like column type modification and adding partitions when cached, are unsupported. Partitioning can lead to excessively large data chunks during export using Dumpling and may cause unexpected issues, such as inconsistent data indexes and incorrect results in certain scenarios. Partitions can be defined using schemes such as range or hash partitioning, and they allow for efficient data loading, deletion, and management. Restrictions exist when adding unique indexes to partitioned tables, especially if they have primary or unique keys. Improvements include automatic updating of statistics and addressing bugs such as inaccurate partition pruning. Partitioned tables can have individual statistics as well as GlobalStats for dynamic pruning. Dropping statistics on a partitioned table deletes statistics for all partitions and GlobalStats.

The statement supports bulk operations and can be combined with a LIMIT clause for constrained deletions. Without a WHERE clause, it affects the entire table but is less efficient than TRUNCATE. In TiDB, adding a lock on a unique key is crucial to prevent issues, as noted in GitHub pull request #20705. The DELETE statement triggers automatic statistics updates and is related to other SQL statements like REPLACE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE. It may encounter problems such as index lookup errors when multi-statement mode is enabled or silent failures during Data Migration (DM) replication if the corresponding row data does not exist. Additionally, in TiCDC improvements, DELETE statements are involved in splitting UPDATE statements during data replication using Avro or CSV protocol with Kafka.

It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations.

TiFlash is optimized for OLAP workloads and supports Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to accelerate complex analytical queries. It can be deployed in both coupled and disaggregated storage and compute architectures, with support for storage backends like Amazon S3. TiFlash supports various query optimizations, including data compaction, distinct optimization, and spilling intermediate data to disk. It is compatible with TiDB and TiSpark, and its performance can be tuned via system variables. TiFlash is recommended for isolating OLAP workloads from OLTP workloads, providing physical isolation on the storage layer and consistent reads. It supports multi-disk deployment and can execute window functions, joins, and aggregations efficiently. TiFlash is continuously updated to enhance its capabilities and address any issues that arise, including numerous bug fixes and improvements related to data consistency, query performance, and stability. It uses gRPC port for improved security, replacing the deprecated default HTTP service port 8123. However, it does not support IPv6 configuration.

It supports both full data migration and incremental data replication, including merging data from sharded MySQL/MariaDB tables. DM handles DDL and DML events from MySQL binlog and offers features like binlog event filtering, block & allow table lists, and customizable replication rules. It is designed to manage table schemas, perform incremental replication, and handle DDL statements based on statement type and migration stage. DM supports online DDL tools like gh-ost and pt-osc to avoid migrating unnecessary intermediate data. It is suitable for various deployment environments, including physical servers and virtualization environments, and supports operating systems like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Enterprise Linux, and Ubuntu on Intel x86-64 architecture. DM provides centralized management of numerous tasks and nodes, high availability, and open-source community support. Despite its robust capabilities, there are limitations regarding sharding DDL usage and performance issues due to algorithm inefficiencies.

It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

TiKV also supports multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) and interacts with TiDB Server via key-value operations. It is responsible for storing both data and metadata, and it replicates data to other components like TiFlash for analytical processing. TiKV is capable of handling hundreds of TBs of data in a cluster size of up to 200 nodes. It supports JSON log format, improved write speed, reduced disk space usage, and provides ordered traversal based on key order. TiKV also addresses various bug fixes and improvements, such as preventing reconnections, optimizing writes, and supporting encryption at rest using algorithms like SM4. Additionally, it supports batch Region split command and empty split command to improve split performance. Furthermore, TiKV includes a bug fix related to the ttl-check-poll-interval configuration issue and utilizes compression, which affects the output of JSON_STORAGE_SIZE(), impacting compatibility with MySQL.\"}, {'id': 242411, 'name': \"Stale Read request's start_ts\", 'description': \"Stale Read request's start_ts in TiKV is not used to update max_ts to avoid excessive commit request retrying.\"}, {'id': 900239, 'name': 'Pessimistic Transactions', 'description': 'A type of database transaction that uses locks to prevent conflicts between concurrent transactions.

It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS.

It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

They are managed by the Placement Driver (PD) and can be dynamically split or merged to balance load, improve performance, and manage data distribution across the cluster. Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data.

The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

RocksDB uses WAL for durability and to ensure data integrity during initial writes and subsequent updates. In RocksDB, all data writes are initially directed to the WAL before being committed to memory structures like MemTables. This ensures data durability and crash recovery capabilities. The WAL operates as a sequential log file where each write operation is recorded atomically. When the MemTable reaches its size limit, it flushes its contents into SST files on disk. RocksDB's architecture allows multiple Column Families (CFs) to share the same WAL, optimizing write operations without increasing the number of writes to the log.

Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data.

Clustering is controlled via system variables in TiDB, unlike systems like InnoDB where clustering is default.

MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS.

It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'.
