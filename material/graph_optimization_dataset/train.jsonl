Although they speed up queries, they can slow down write operations and consume additional storage space.

It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data.

In a multi-PD setup, only one instance runs the TiDB Dashboard, and access to PD instances can be affected by firewall or reverse proxy configurations.\"}, {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL', 'description': \"MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its performance, reliability, and ease of use. It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS. It also serves as a source database for data migration, including utilities like mysql_tzinfo_to_sql for loading time zone information, which may encounter errors such as 'Error 1298: Unknown or incorrect time zone: 'UTC'' if time zone data isn't properly loaded.\"}, {'id': 47984, 'name': 'Database Privileges', 'description': 'Permissions granted to a user to access and perform actions on specific databases.'}], 'relationships': [{'id': 51027, 'relationship': 'The SHOW DATABASES statement is used to view databases.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-create-database', 'source_entity': {'id': 660035, 'name': 'Database'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 480048, 'name': 'SHOW DATABASES statement'}}, {'id': 41480, 'relationship': 'Disconnected sessions can be caused by network connectivity issues.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-5.4.2', 'source_entity': {'id': 43468, 'name': 'Disconnected session'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 43467, 'name': 'Network connectivity issue'}}, {'id': 66919, 'relationship': 'CREATE DATABASE is used to create new databases that can be listed by SHOW DATABASES.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-statement-show-databases', 'source_entity': {'id': 362581, 'name': 'SHOW DATABASES'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 47988, 'name': 'CREATE DATABASE'}}, {'id': 53877, 'relationship': 'Only one of the PD instances actually runs TiDB Dashboard.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dashboard-ops-reverse-proxy', 'source_entity': {'id': 510050, 'name': 'TiDB Dashboard'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 360905, 'name': 'PD Instance'}}, {'id': 66917, 'relationship': \"TiDB's SHOW DATABASES statement is designed to be compatible with MySQL's behavior.\", 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-statement-show-databases', 'source_entity': {'id': 362581, 'name': 'SHOW DATABASES'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 66908, 'relationship': 'SHOW DATABASES displays only databases the user has privileges to access.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/sql-statement-show-databases', 'source_entity': {'id': 362581, 'name': 'SHOW DATABASES'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 47984, 'name': 'Database Privileges'}}]}", "answer": "<issue>\nreasoning: Entity \"SHOW DATABASES statement\" (ID: 480048) and \"SHOW DATABASES\" (ID: 362581) refer to the same SQL command.

It supports Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) by replicating data from TiKV using the Raft Learner protocol, ensuring strong consistency and snapshot isolation. TiFlash is optimized for OLAP workloads and supports Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to accelerate complex analytical queries. It can be deployed in both coupled and disaggregated storage and compute architectures, with support for storage backends like Amazon S3. TiFlash supports various query optimizations, including data compaction, distinct optimization, and spilling intermediate data to disk. It is compatible with TiDB and TiSpark, and its performance can be tuned via system variables. TiFlash is recommended for isolating OLAP workloads from OLTP workloads, providing physical isolation on the storage layer and consistent reads. It supports multi-disk deployment and can execute window functions, joins, and aggregations efficiently. TiFlash is continuously updated to enhance its capabilities and address any issues that arise, including numerous bug fixes and improvements related to data consistency, query performance, and stability.

It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS.

Partition pruning is applied based on the partition type and expression, and writing is supported with utf8mb4_bin collation. Optimized memory usage and performance during analyze operations are key features. In TiDB, partitioned tables improve query performance, manageability, and availability by allowing operations on smaller parts of the table. They enhance query speed, particularly for operations like TRUNCATE and DROP, and support features such as backup and restore. However, certain operations, like column type modification and adding partitions when cached, are unsupported. Partitioning can lead to excessively large data chunks during export using Dumpling and may cause unexpected issues, such as inconsistent data indexes and incorrect results in certain scenarios. Partitions can be defined using schemes such as range or hash partitioning, and they allow for efficient data loading, deletion, and management. Restrictions exist when adding unique indexes to partitioned tables, especially if they have primary or unique keys. Improvements include automatic updating of statistics and addressing bugs such as inaccurate partition pruning.

Optimized memory usage and performance during analyze operations are key features. In TiDB, partitioned tables improve query performance, manageability, and availability by allowing operations on smaller parts of the table. They enhance query speed, particularly for operations like TRUNCATE and DROP, and support features such as backup and restore. However, certain operations, like column type modification and adding partitions when cached, are unsupported. Partitioning can lead to excessively large data chunks during export using Dumpling and may cause unexpected issues, such as inconsistent data indexes and incorrect results in certain scenarios. Partitions can be defined using schemes such as range or hash partitioning, and they allow for efficient data loading, deletion, and management. Restrictions exist when adding unique indexes to partitioned tables, especially if they have primary or unique keys. Improvements include automatic updating of statistics and addressing bugs such as inaccurate partition pruning.

Known issues include exiting when transporting a transaction greater than 1 GB and failures to send requests to Pump when the compressor is set to zip.

Tables are essential components within TiDB clusters, subordinate to databases, and serve as the base for views and other database objects.Tables can be created using the CREATE TABLE statement, modified with ALTER TABLE, and their data managed through operations like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT. They support various SQL commands such as SHOW CREATE TABLE, SHOW COLUMNS FROM, and can be loaded using the LOAD DATA statement. Each table must have at least one column and adheres to naming rules: names should start with letters (a-z, A-Z) or numbers (0-9), and may include letters, numbers, and underscores (_).Tables in TiDB are initially stored in one region by default, with their splitting behavior controlled by the `split-table` configuration. They can have a TTL attribute configured, where TTL operations are performed at the table level. Placement policies can be attached to tables to control data replication and influence their storage distribution.Key features of tables include:- Support for clustered or non-clustered indexes.- Primary keys that can be defined as either clustered or non-clustered indexes.- The ability to be replicated in systems like TiFlash, with the number of replicas managed via DDL statements.- Options such as AUTO_INCREMENT, SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS, PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS, and AUTO_ID_CACHE can be specified during creation.Tables are the target objects for various SQL statements, including SHOW CREATE TABLE, SHOW [FULL] COLUMNS FROM, CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX, SHOW INDEXES, and ALTER INDEX. They can also be truncated using the TRUNCATE statement and their structure modified with the ALTER TABLE statement. Columns can be removed using the DROP COLUMN statement.In addition to these features, tables store data from SQL statements and can be locked using the `LOCK STATS` command to manage statistics.'}], 'relationships': [{'id': 90628, 'relationship': 'TiFlash Replicas are stored in TiFlash.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/create-tiflash-replicas', 'source_entity': {'id': 900445, 'name': 'TiFlash Replica'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540074, 'name': 'TiFlash'}}, {'id': 38702, 'relationship': 'TiFlash replicates table metadata.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-6.5.11', 'source_entity': {'id': 40286, 'name': 'TiFlash Table Metadata Replication'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540074, 'name': 'TiFlash'}}, {'id': 38944, 'relationship': 'TiFlash replica replication mechanism is optimized.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-6.0.0-dmr', 'source_entity': {'id': 540074, 'name': 'TiFlash'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 40533, 'name': 'TiFlash replica replication'}}, {'id': 41748, 'relationship': 'TiFlash provides the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_REPLICA system table.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-7.3.0', 'source_entity': {'id': 540074, 'name': 'TiFlash'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 43825, 'name': 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_REPLICA'}}, {'id': 41781, 'relationship': 'The INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_REPLICA system table contained tables that users did not have privileges to access, which has been fixed.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-7.3.0', 'source_entity': {'id': 540074, 'name': 'TiFlash'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 43825, 'name': 'INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_REPLICA'}}, {'id': 90606, 'relationship': 'Setting replicas for system tables has restrictions in later TiDB versions.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/create-tiflash-replicas', 'source_entity': {'id': 90495, 'name': 'System Table'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 900445, 'name': 'TiFlash Replica'}}, {'id': 90592, 'relationship': 'TiFlash Replicas are copies of specific tables.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/create-tiflash-replicas', 'source_entity': {'id': 900445, 'name': 'TiFlash Replica'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 720283, 'name': 'Table'}}]}", "answer": "<issue>\nreasoning: \"TiFlash Table Metadata Replication\" (ID: 40286) has a very brief description: \"The process of replicating TiFlash table metadata within the cluster.\" This description is vague and doesn't provide specific information about what the process entails, how it works, or its significance in the TiFlash ecosystem.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [40286]\n</issue>\n\n<issue>\nreasoning: \"TiFlash replica replication\" (ID: 40533) has an extremely brief description: \"The replica replication mechanism for TiFlash.\" This description lacks detail about what the mechanism does, how it works, or its importance within the TiFlash system.

It can delete all rows if no WHERE clause is specified or target specific rows using the WHERE clause. The statement supports bulk operations and can be combined with a LIMIT clause for constrained deletions. Without a WHERE clause, it affects the entire table but is less efficient than TRUNCATE. In TiDB, adding a lock on a unique key is crucial to prevent issues, as noted in GitHub pull request #20705. The DELETE statement triggers automatic statistics updates and is related to other SQL statements like REPLACE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE. It may encounter problems such as index lookup errors when multi-statement mode is enabled or silent failures during Data Migration (DM) replication if the corresponding row data does not exist. Additionally, in TiCDC improvements, DELETE statements are involved in splitting UPDATE statements during data replication using Avro or CSV protocol with Kafka. In systems like TiDB, it marks data for deletion without immediately removing it from disk, thus not reducing disk usage promptly.'}, {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL', 'description': \"MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its performance, reliability, and ease of use. It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations.

Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently.

In TiDB, OOM can happen when loading statistics during startup or due to high memory consumption by result sets exceeding the `tidb_mem_quota_query` limit. In TiKV, specific causes include resolved timestamps in stale reads when tracking large transactions, restarting TiKV with a large number of unapplied Raft logs, and backing up a large Region, which may lead to restarts.

The default value is 6 MiB (6291456 bytes), and it can be increased up to 120 MiB (125829120 bytes). This parameter affects the storage of large string types like MEDIUMBLOB and LONGBLOB, and exceeding this limit results in an 'entry too large' error. Since v7.6.0, it can be dynamically modified using the `tidb_txn_entry_size_limit` system variable. The `txn-total-size-limit` parameter controls the total size of a single transaction. Prior to v6.5.0, the default value was 100 MiB (104857600 bytes) with a maximum of 1 TB. From v6.5.0 onwards, this configuration is deprecated and transaction memory is accounted for within the session memory, controlled by `tidb_mem_quota_query`. However, explicitly setting `txn-total-size-limit` to a non-default value overrides `tidb_mem_quota_query` and continues to govern transaction size.

Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data.

The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

They are commonly found in partitioned tables but are not strictly mandatory, as seen in examples like 't_5', 't_6', and 't_7'. In databases like TiDB, primary keys can be integer or non-integer types with attributes such as AUTO_INCREMENT for sequential numbering or AUTO_RANDOM to avoid write hotspots. They can also be composite (e.g., book_id and user_id) and explicitly defined as clustered or non-clustered indexes. Clustering is controlled via system variables in TiDB, unlike systems like InnoDB where clustering is default. If no primary key is specified, an implicit '_tidb_rowid' is used, which may lead to write hotspots but can be mitigated with sharding parameters. Primary keys are crucial for efficient data retrieval and transactions, such as selecting a primary TiKV node in TiDB's 2PC process.

MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS.

This mechanism is integral to managing historical data efficiently across components like TiDB, TiKV, and Titan. GC operates as part of the Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) implementation, helping to free up storage and improve system performance. It uses a safe point, calculated as the current time minus the GC life time, to determine which data can be safely deleted. The process involves several steps including Resolve Locks, Delete Ranges, and leverages RocksDB's compaction filter for efficient data removal. GC operates in DISTRIBUTED mode by default since TiDB 3.0, with older versions using CENTRAL mode. It interacts with components like TiFlash (affecting CMSketch memory allocation) and TiCDC (removing replicated history data). GC can be enabled or disabled using specific commands ('SET GLOBAL tidb_gc_enable=TRUE'/'FALSE') and its status verified through 'SELECT @@global.tidb_gc_enable'. The process is paused during backup to prevent data loss, ensuring that data remains recoverable before it is removed.
