TiFlash is optimized for OLAP workloads and supports Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to accelerate complex analytical queries. It can be deployed in both coupled and disaggregated storage and compute architectures, with support for storage backends like Amazon S3. TiFlash supports various query optimizations, including data compaction, distinct optimization, and spilling intermediate data to disk. It is compatible with TiDB and TiSpark, and its performance can be tuned via system variables. TiFlash is recommended for isolating OLAP workloads from OLTP workloads, providing physical isolation on the storage layer and consistent reads. It supports multi-disk deployment and can execute window functions, joins, and aggregations efficiently. TiFlash is continuously updated to enhance its capabilities and address any issues that arise, including numerous bug fixes and improvements related to data consistency, query performance, and stability.

It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

Features include batch split support, row count-based region splitting, expression pushdowns including string, aggregation, encryption, and cast functions, and support for both optimistic and pessimistic transactions. TiKV dynamically adjusts resource quotas, handles backup/restore operations, supports encryption using AES or SM4, and can operate as a standalone key-value store (RawKV) without TiDB. It is used in TiDB Cloud and self-hosted platforms, deployable with or without TiFlash. Sufficient resources are recommended for optimal performance, and disk sharing is not advised. TiKV is scalable in the Dedicated Tier on AWS for clusters created post-December 31, 2022.

TiKV uses the Raft consensus algorithm for fault tolerance and data replication, and it supports distributed transactions with ACID compliance using a two-phase commit protocol. It acts as the underlying storage engine, storing data in Regions, which are replicated across multiple nodes for high availability. TiKV is integrated with TiSpark for analytics and can be managed using TiUP. It supports various configurations and optimizations, including Raft Engine and RocksDB as storage engines, and offers features like quick backup and restoration, reading from follower replicas, and dynamic resource quota adjustments. TiKV is also involved in handling transaction commit requests and supports pushdown of operators like Limit and TopN. It is monitored and diagnosed using tools like Grafana and the Performance Overview Dashboard.'}, {'id': 363142, 'name': 'Projection', 'description': 'Projection is a database operation and a stage in the query execution plan that selects specific columns from a table or input data. It is a relational algebra operation used in various execution plans, including those involving TiFlash and TiKV coprocessors. The projection operator is often pushed down by the optimizer to improve performance. Projection operations are part of the query execution plan and involve selecting specific columns for processing. They can be executed on either TiFlash or TiKV coprocessors depending on the task and data requirements. Performance statistics, such as execution times and resource usage, are typically included in the execution plan details. Projection operations are crucial for optimizing data retrieval by reducing the amount of data processed during queries.'}, {'id': 540074, 'name': 'TiFlash', 'description': 'TiFlash is a columnar storage engine and analytical component of the TiDB ecosystem, designed to enhance analytical processing capabilities and provide real-time analytics. It supports Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) by replicating data from TiKV using the Raft Learner protocol, ensuring strong consistency and snapshot isolation. TiFlash is optimized for OLAP workloads and supports Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to accelerate complex analytical queries. It can be deployed in both coupled and disaggregated storage and compute architectures, with support for storage backends like Amazon S3. TiFlash supports various query optimizations, including data compaction, distinct optimization, and spilling intermediate data to disk. It is compatible with TiDB and TiSpark, and its performance can be tuned via system variables. TiFlash is recommended for isolating OLAP workloads from OLTP workloads, providing physical isolation on the storage layer and consistent reads. It supports multi-disk deployment and can execute window functions, joins, and aggregations efficiently. TiFlash is continuously updated to enhance its capabilities and address any issues that arise, including numerous bug fixes and improvements related to data consistency, query performance, and stability. It uses gRPC port for improved security, replacing the deprecated default HTTP service port 8123. However, it does not support IPv6 configuration. Upgrading from versions earlier than v5.3.0 to v5.3.0 or later requires stopping TiFlash. Major version upgrades (e.g., v4.x to v6.x) are not recommended; instead, incremental upgrades (v4.x -> v5.x -> v6.x) are advised. V4.x is nearing end-of-life, and upgrading to v5.x or later is recommended. Downgrading from v6.1 to earlier versions might lead to TiFlash restart failures due to RocksDB configuration incompatibility.'}, {'id': 660099, 'name': 'Optimizer', 'description': \"The Optimizer is a critical component in TiDB responsible for generating efficient query execution plans. It analyzes SQL queries, considering factors such as table statistics, indexes, available resources, and optimizer hints (e.g., LEADING). The optimizer determines the most efficient way to execute queries by evaluating costs and selecting optimal execution strategies. It handles memory limits when building scan ranges, employs techniques like partition pruning based on the WHERE clause, and can derive TopN or Limit operators from window functions. The optimizer's behavior is influenced by system parameters such as `tidb_enforce_mpp`, `tidb_opt_prefer_range_scan`, and others, ensuring queries are executed as efficiently as possible. In TiDB v8.0.0, the query optimizer has been enhanced to better support multi-valued indexes, collecting statistics on these indexes for execution plan decisions and creating Index Merge plans for OR conditions with 'member of'. Additionally, it estimates subquery result set sizes and determines appropriate join algorithms, selecting physical implementations based on data statistics to achieve the lowest overall cost. The SEMI_JOIN_REWRITE() hint can influence the optimizer's choices, and it uses cost estimation to determine whether to select the MPP mode.\"}, {'id': 362746, 'name': 'Coprocessor', 'description': 'The Coprocessor is a component within TiKV, TiDB, and TiFlash that enhances performance by processing queries close to the storage layer. It reduces data transfer between TiKV/TiFlash and TiDB, improving query performance by executing computations such as pushed down predicates, projections, and aggregate functions, including DISTINCT optimization. The Coprocessor supports most built-in SQL functions, SQL LIMIT operations, index scans, and table scans. By executing computations on the storage layer, it minimizes data transfer over the network and improves query performance. It handles vector calculations, expressions, and processes requests, including features like scan range statistics. The Coprocessor also addresses issues related to stale data, preventing the return of stale data when removing a Raft peer, and fixes issues such as panics caused by large response sizes exceeding 4 GiB and timeouts during request processing. It executes operations such as TableFullScan and StreamAgg, allowing TiDB to push down computation logic to the storage layer for processing within each Region, offloading processing from TiDB and enabling data processing closer to the storage layer.

TiFlash is optimized for OLAP workloads and supports Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to accelerate complex analytical queries. It can be deployed in both coupled and disaggregated storage and compute architectures, with support for storage backends like Amazon S3. TiFlash supports various query optimizations, including data compaction, distinct optimization, and spilling intermediate data to disk. It is compatible with TiDB and TiSpark, and its performance can be tuned via system variables. TiFlash is recommended for isolating OLAP workloads from OLTP workloads, providing physical isolation on the storage layer and consistent reads. It supports multi-disk deployment and can execute window functions, joins, and aggregations efficiently. TiFlash is continuously updated to enhance its capabilities and address any issues that arise, including numerous bug fixes and improvements related to data consistency, query performance, and stability.

This variable limits the memory usage of a single TiDB server instance and is GLOBAL scoped, persisting across the cluster. When the limit is reached, TiDB cancels the most memory-intensive SQL statement exceeding `tidb_server_memory_limit_sess_min_size`. It affects the `tidb_gogc_tuner_threshold` system variable, and modifying it should trigger an adjustment in the `tidb_gogc_ tuner_threshold`.

They serve multiple purposes, including full data migration to and from TiDB, and can be configured with parameters like separator, delimiter, header, and more, specified in the `[mydumper.csv]` section. In strict-format mode, CSV files enable parallel processing but necessitate conditions such as an empty delimiter and explicit line terminator to prevent data corruption. Additionally, CSV files support compression for import, large file splitting using `Split_File`, and user-defined terminators during Dumpling export. Importing without line break characters at the end can lead to errors. CSV files are also utilized in TiDB Cloud for data import, requiring schema definitions beforehand.

Partition pruning is applied based on the partition type and expression, and writing is supported with utf8mb4_bin collation. Optimized memory usage and performance during analyze operations are key features.

SET TIFLASH REPLICA count` or `ALTER DATABASE db_name SET TIFLASH REPLICA count`, where 'count' specifies the number of replicas (0 for deletion). They are created by taking a snapshot from TiKV, with the creation speed managed by PD, defaulting to 30 regions per minute, adjustable via the PD Control command-line tool. The progress and availability of replicas can be checked via the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TIFLASH_REPLICA` table. Successful DDL execution does not guarantee complete replication; thus, it is essential to verify readiness before use. System tables, views, temporary tables, and tables with unsupported character sets are skipped during replica creation. The number of TiFlash replicas should be less than or equal to the number of TiKV nodes and is limited by the number of TiFlash nodes available.

It supports Hybrid Transactional/Analytical Processing (HTAP) by replicating data from TiKV using the Raft Learner protocol, ensuring strong consistency and snapshot isolation. TiFlash is optimized for OLAP workloads and supports Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to accelerate complex analytical queries. It can be deployed in both coupled and disaggregated storage and compute architectures, with support for storage backends like Amazon S3. TiFlash supports various query optimizations, including data compaction, distinct optimization, and spilling intermediate data to disk. It is compatible with TiDB and TiSpark, and its performance can be tuned via system variables. TiFlash is recommended for isolating OLAP workloads from OLTP workloads, providing physical isolation on the storage layer and consistent reads. It supports multi-disk deployment and can execute window functions, joins, and aggregations efficiently. TiFlash is continuously updated to enhance its capabilities and address any issues that arise, including numerous bug fixes and improvements related to data consistency, query performance, and stability. It uses gRPC port for improved security, replacing the deprecated default HTTP service port 8123. However, it does not support IPv6 configuration. Upgrading from versions earlier than v5.3.0 to v5.3.0 or later requires stopping TiFlash.

They support various SQL commands such as SHOW CREATE TABLE, SHOW COLUMNS FROM, and can be loaded using the LOAD DATA statement. Each table must have at least one column and adheres to naming rules: names should start with letters (a-z, A-Z) or numbers (0-9), and may include letters, numbers, and underscores (_).Tables in TiDB are initially stored in one region by default, with their splitting behavior controlled by the `split-table` configuration. They can have a TTL attribute configured, where TTL operations are performed at the table level. Placement policies can be attached to tables to control data replication and influence their storage distribution.Key features of tables include:- Support for clustered or non-clustered indexes.- Primary keys that can be defined as either clustered or non-clustered indexes.- The ability to be replicated in systems like TiFlash, with the number of replicas managed via DDL statements.- Options such as AUTO_INCREMENT, SHARD_ROW_ID_BITS, PRE_SPLIT_REGIONS, and AUTO_ID_CACHE can be specified during creation.Tables are the target objects for various SQL statements, including SHOW CREATE TABLE, SHOW [FULL] COLUMNS FROM, CREATE INDEX, DROP INDEX, SHOW INDEXES, and ALTER INDEX.

MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS.

It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

This parameter affects the storage of large string types like MEDIUMBLOB and LONGBLOB, and exceeding this limit results in an 'entry too large' error. Since v7.6.0, it can be dynamically modified using the `tidb_txn_entry_size_limit` system variable. The `txn-total-size-limit` parameter controls the total size of a single transaction. Prior to v6.5.0, the default value was 100 MiB (104857600 bytes) with a maximum of 1 TB. From v6.5.0 onwards, this configuration is deprecated and transaction memory is accounted for within the session memory, controlled by `tidb_mem_quota_query`. However, explicitly setting `txn-total-size-limit` to a non-default value overrides `tidb_mem_quota_query` and continues to govern transaction size. This parameter is crucial for operations like `LOAD DATA`, where increasing the limit can resolve 'Transaction is too large' errors.\"}, {'id': 361696, 'name': 'TiDB OOM Issue', 'description': \"Out of Memory (OOM) issues in TiDB can manifest as client errors like 'ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query,' and can be identified through logs such as dmesg (OOM-killer logs), tidb.log ('Welcome to TiDB' after restart, 'expensive_query' (v3.0.0+) or 'memory exceeds quota' (pre-v3.0.0)), and tidb_stderr.log ('fatal error: runtime: out of memory' or 'cannot allocate memory' in v2.1.8+, 'fatal error: stack overflow' pre-v2.1.8).

It represents a contiguous range of key-alue pairs and serves as a logical division of data, similar to a shard or partition in other databases. Regions are distributed among multiple TiKV instances to facilitate data distribution, fault tolerance, and high availability. They are managed by the Placement Driver (PD) and can be dynamically split or merged to balance load, improve performance, and manage data distribution across the cluster. Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data.

RocksDB uses WAL for durability and to ensure data integrity during initial writes and subsequent updates. In RocksDB, all data writes are initially directed to the WAL before being committed to memory structures like MemTables. This ensures data durability and crash recovery capabilities. The WAL operates as a sequential log file where each write operation is recorded atomically. When the MemTable reaches its size limit, it flushes its contents into SST files on disk. RocksDB's architecture allows multiple Column Families (CFs) to share the same WAL, optimizing write operations without increasing the number of writes to the log.

They are managed by the Placement Driver (PD) and can be dynamically split or merged to balance load, improve performance, and manage data distribution across the cluster. Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data.

The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes.

Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported.

DM handles DDL and DML events from MySQL binlog and offers features like binlog event filtering, block & allow table lists, and customizable replication rules. It is designed to manage table schemas, perform incremental replication, and handle DDL statements based on statement type and migration stage. DM supports online DDL tools like gh-ost and pt-osc to avoid migrating unnecessary intermediate data. It is suitable for various deployment environments, including physical servers and virtualization environments, and supports operating systems like Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Oracle Enterprise Linux, and Ubuntu on Intel x86-64 architecture. DM provides centralized management of numerous tasks and nodes, high availability, and open-source community support.
