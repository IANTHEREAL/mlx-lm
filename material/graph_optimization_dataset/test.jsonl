{"prompt": "Optimize the following graph:\n{'entities': [{'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB', 'description': \"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\"}, {'id': 35953, 'name': 'NULL Value Handling', 'description': 'The way TiDB handles NULL values in partitioning expressions.

{"prompt": "Optimize the following graph:\n{'entities': [{'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB', 'description': \"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\"}, {'id': 39935, 'name': 'MySQL 8.0 Compatibility', 'description': 'Improved compatibility between TiDB 7.4.0 and MySQL 8.0, facilitating smoother migrations and replications.'}, {'id': 660066, 'name': 'MySQL 8.0', 'description': \"MySQL 8.0 is a specific version of the MySQL relational database management system, known for introducing features such as roles, window functions, and comprehensive support for date and time functions. It sets utf8mb4 as the default character set with utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci as the collation. The SQL mode includes settings like ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY and ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO. MySQL 8.0 is compatible with TiDB, particularly in role management and UTF-8 validity checks, serving as a reference for its string functions and Data Migration (DM). Documentation of its functions often refers to the official MySQL 8.0 documentation. Additionally, TiDB's `SET ROLE` statement is fully compatible with MySQL 8.0's roles feature. This version may cause 'invalid sequence' reports in DM.\"}, {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL', 'description': \"MySQL is a popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its performance, reliability, and ease of use. It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS. It also serves as a source database for data migration, including utilities like mysql_tzinfo_to_sql for loading time zone information, which may encounter errors such as 'Error 1298: Unknown or incorrect time zone: 'UTC'' if time zone data isn't properly loaded.\"}], 'relationships': [{'id': 38356, 'relationship': 'TiDB 7.4.0 has enhanced compatibility with MySQL 8.0.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-7.4.0', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 39935, 'name': 'MySQL 8.0 Compatibility'}}, {'id': 38614, 'relationship': 'TiDB 7.4.0 is compatible with essential features of MySQL 8.0.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/release-7.4.0', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 660066, 'name': 'MySQL 8.0'}}, {'id': 31086, 'relationship': 'TiDB is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol and common features of MySQL 5.7 and 8.0.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/mysql-compatibility', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 91502, 'relationship': 'TiDB is compatible with MySQL.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-tidb-crud-sql', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 58896, 'relationship': 'TiDB is highly compatible with the MySQL protocol and common features of MySQL 5.7 and 8.0.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/mysql-compatibility', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 59877, 'relationship': 'TiDB is compatible with MySQL.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/character-set-and-collation', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 150168, 'relationship': 'TiDB is designed to be compatible with MySQL.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/mysql-compatibility', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 91005, 'relationship': 'TiDB is compatible with MySQL.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidbcloud/dev-guide-sample-application-python-mysql-connector', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 50066, 'relationship': 'TiDB is compatible with MySQL.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/dev-guide-sample-application-python-django', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 540080, 'name': 'MySQL'}}, {'id': 30066, 'relationship': 'TiDB also supports some security features of MySQL 8.0.', 'doc_link': 'https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/v8.1/security-compatibility-with-mysql', 'source_entity': {'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB'}, 'target_entity': {'id': 660066, 'name': 'MySQL 8.0'}}]}", "answer": "<analysis>\nreasoning: I observe multiple relationships with identical text: \"TiDB is compatible with MySQL\" appears in relationships with IDs 91502, 59877, 91005, and 50066.

TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability.

However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\"}, {'id': 363314, 'name': 'Unique Index', 'description': 'A unique index ensures that all values in a specified column or set of columns are distinct, preventing duplicate entries.

These partitions can be based on specified criteria such as range or hash partitioning. TiSpark supports reading and writing range and hash partitioned tables with certain restrictions on partition expressions. Partition pruning is applied based on the partition type and expression, and writing is supported with utf8mb4_bin collation. Optimized memory usage and performance during analyze operations are key features. In TiDB, partitioned tables improve query performance, manageability, and availability by allowing operations on smaller parts of the table. They enhance query speed, particularly for operations like TRUNCATE and DROP, and support features such as backup and restore. However, certain operations, like column type modification and adding partitions when cached, are unsupported. Partitioning can lead to excessively large data chunks during export using Dumpling and may cause unexpected issues, such as inconsistent data indexes and incorrect results in certain scenarios. Partitions can be defined using schemes such as range or hash partitioning, and they allow for efficient data loading, deletion, and management. Restrictions exist when adding unique indexes to partitioned tables, especially if they have primary or unique keys. Improvements include automatic updating of statistics and addressing bugs such as inaccurate partition pruning.

In TiDB v8.0.0, the optimizer's support for multi-valued indexes is further enhanced, allowing it to collect statistics, identify lower cost indexes, and use them in execution plan decisions. Multi-valued indexes can be composite, consisting of multiple columns, and are created on JSON arrays extracted from JSON documents. They are used in conjunction with JSON functions like JSON_CONTAINS and JSON_OVERLAPS, allowing efficient searches across multiple values within a single array field.

It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\"}, {'id': 362914, 'name': 'Support Ticket', 'description': 'A Support Ticket is a formal request for assistance submitted to the TiDB or TiDB Cloud support team.

It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format.
