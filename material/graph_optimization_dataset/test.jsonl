Drainer supports features like TLS for secure data transfer, configurable Kafka client ID, incremental backup data purging, and relay log support. It can be configured via command-line parameters or a configuration file (drainer.toml) and is managed by binlogctl and SQL statements. Drainer can be paused, closed, or redeployed after a critical error, and its state is stored in PD. It also supports bidirectional replication by marking and filtering events to prevent infinite loops.

Known issues include exiting when transporting a transaction greater than 1 GB and failures to send requests to Pump when the compressor is set to zip.

Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regions—four for row data and one for index data.
