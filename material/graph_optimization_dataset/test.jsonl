It supports both physical and logical import modes, enabling high performance and scalability for large-scale data migration tasks. The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter. By default, this setting pauses scheduling for the region storing the target table data. However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

Your task is to analyze the knowledge graph and identify and describe issues within the knowledge graph to facilitate quality improvements while preserving knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n- **Non-redundant**: No duplicate entities or relationships\n- **Coherent**: Relationships and entities form a logical structure\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous descriptions\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge is correct\n- **Efficiently connected**: Ensuring optimal pathways between related entities, and avoiding unnecessary redundant connections.\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**\n  - Definition: Multiple entities that represent the same real-world entity (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Obvious similarity in names, and descriptions.\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**\n  - Definition: Multiple relationships connecting the same (or nearly identical) source and target entity pair, with identical semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Identical (or nearly identical) source/target entities and identical relationship description.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User → Purchased → Product and Customer → Ordered → Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User → Purchased in 2023 → Product and Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product.\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**\n  - Definition: Flaws in entity definitions or descriptions that reduce clarity, accuracy, or usability.\n  - Subtypes:\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contradictory or conflicting attributes (e.g., User labeled as both \"Active\" and \"Deleted\").\n    - Meaningless Descriptions: Vague, unclear, or non-specific text (e.g., \"Entity related to something\").\n    - Ambiguous Description: Applies to multiple concepts or lacks specificity (e.g., \"A system that manages data\").\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**\n  - Definition: Flaws in relationship definitions that obscure their purpose or logic.\n  - Subtypes:\n    - Unclear Expression: Relationships poorly defined (e.g., \"connected to\" without context).\n    - Missing Essential Meaning: Fails to unambiguously describe the connection between entities.\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n\n5. **Missing Meaningful Relationships**\n  - Definition: The absence of a direct relationship between two existing entities where such a relationship would significantly improve the graph's completeness, coherence, or utility.\n  - Identification: Requires reasoning about the entities' nature and the graph's context to determine if a high-value connection is missing.\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis should be thorough, and your final output must strictly follow this format:\n\n1.
