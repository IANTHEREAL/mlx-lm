{"prompt": "Optimize the following graph:\n{'entities': [{'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB', 'description': \"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\", 'meta': '{\"CTE behavior\": {\"details\": [\"Handles recursive CTE data length exceeding seed part with a warning in strict mode.\", \"Determines recursive CTE data type from the seed part.\", \"Allows \\'UNION\\' followed by \\'UNION ALL\\' with multiple UNION operators.\", \"Reports errors for problematic CTE definitions even if the CTE is not referenced.\"], \"status\": \"need-revised\"}, \"Version\": \"v4.0.4\", \"action\": \"Scans all partitions of table \\'t1\\'\", \"behavior\": [\"Performs an index range scan based on eq(test.t2.b, test.t1.b) when subquery decorrelation is disabled.\", \"always displays the complete numeric value\"], \"community\": \"Available support via community and tickets\", \"compatibility\": \"MySQL\", \"compatibility_change\": {\"description\": \"Changed the default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` from `2` to `1`.\"}, \"components\": [\"TiKV\", \"TiFlash\", \"TiCDC\", \"BR\", \"Dumpling/ Sqldump\", \"SQL parser\", \"SQL query optimizer\", \"SQL executor\", \"Server\"], \"date_formats\": [\"\\'YYYY- MM- DD\\' or \\'YY- MM- DD\\'\", \"\\'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\\' or \\'YYMMDDHHMMSS\\'\", \"YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS\"], \"decimal_ field_ modification\": {\"error\": \"ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision\"}, \"details\": [\"Converts `IN` subqueries to semi joins.\", \"Converts `= ANY` subqueries to left outer semi joins.\", \"Optimizes null-aware semi joins in `WHERE` clause to inner joins and aggregates.\", \"Handles null-aware semi joins by calculating Cartesian product and filtering.\", \"Use \\'SHOW BUILTINS\\' to list available functions.\", \"Supports most, but not all, MySQL built-in functions.\"], \"error_ handling\": {\"specific_errors\": [\"ErrWriteConflict\", \"ErrTxnRetryable\"]}, \"execution_plan_observation\": \"The provided execution plan details are from TiDB.\", \"features\": [\"MySQL Compatibility\", \"Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)\", \"Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)\", \"Online Unsafe Recovery\", \"Partition Pruning\", \"Optimizer Hints\", \"GBK Character Set Support\"], \"functionality\": \"Supports aggregate functions (including COUNT)\", \"interaction_details\": [\"Obtains TSOs from PD\", \"Communicates with PD for cluster management\"], \"memory_control\": {\"system_variable\": \"tidb_ mem_ quota_ query\"}, \"optimization\": \"Implements `tidb_opt_distinct_agg_push_down` for performance improvement.\", \"properties\": {\"Default Resource Group\": \"Provides a default resource group with unlimited resources\", \"Resource Allocation in Overcapacity\": \"Prioritizes resource groups with higher priority and allocates proportionally within same priority based on RU_PER_SEC\", \"Resource Control Metrics Collection\": \"Regularly collects runtime information about resource control\", \"Resource Control Metrics Visualization\": \"Provides visual charts in Grafana\\'s TiDB > Resource Control dashboard\", \"deployment_options\": [\"TiDB Self-Managed\", \"TiDB Cloud\"], \"monitoring_tool\": \"Grafana\", \"role\": \"Requests TSO from PD\", \"ttl_metrics_tables\": [\"mysql.tidb_ttl_table_status\", \"mysql.tidb_ttl_task\", \"mysql.tidb_ttl_job_history\"], \"type\": \"distributed SQL database\", \"uses\": \"PD Client to batch TSO requests\"}, \"reason\": \"Due to the non-sargable predicate\", \"source_descriptions\": [\"Derived from from relationship: TiDB Lightning -> TiDB Lightning imports data into TiDB.\", \"Derived from from relationship: TiDB Lightning -> TiDB Lightning imports data into TiDB clusters. -> TiDB\"], \"statement_summary_tables\": {\"description\": \"Provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL\\'s `events_statements_summary_by_digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1 and also provides statement summary tables in `information_schema`.\"}, \"status\": \"need-revised\", \"topic\": \"TiDB Enhancements\", \"type\": \"Distributed SQL database\"}'}, {'id': 39935, 'name': 'MySQL 8.0 Compatibility', 'description': 'Improved compatibility between TiDB 7.4.0 and MySQL 8.0, facilitating smoother migrations and replications.', 'meta': '{\"purpose\": \"Smoother migrations and replications with default collation.\", \"topic\": \"Compatibility\", \"version\": \"8.0\"}'}, {'id': 660066, 'name': 'MySQL 8.0', 'description': \"MySQL 8.0 is a specific version of the MySQL relational database management system, known for introducing features such as roles, window functions, and comprehensive support for date and time functions.

It serves as both a source and target in data migration processes, supporting various configurations such as host, port, user credentials, and TLS settings within tools like TiDB Data Migration (DM). MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported. Added arguments for AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() include 'kdf_name', 'salt', and 'iterations'. MySQL is used as a target system for TiCDC data replication, where TiCDC splits an UPDATE event into DELETE and INSERT events when using the MySQL sink if the transaction commitTS is less than TiCDC's thresholdTS. It also serves as a source database for data migration, including utilities like mysql_tzinfo_to_sql for loading time zone information, which may encounter errors such as 'Error 1298: Unknown or incorrect time zone: 'UTC'' if time zone data isn't properly loaded.\", 'meta': '{\"added_arguments\": {\"AES_DECRYPT()\": [\"kdf_name\", \"salt\", \"iterations\"], \"AES_ENCRYPT()\": [\"kdf_name\", \"salt\", \"iterations\"]}, \"binlog_format\": \"ROW format required for binlog value filter\", \"bug_reporting\": \"https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/support\", \"changes\": [{\"condition\": \"transaction `commitTS` for the `UPDATE` change is less than TiCDC `thresholdTS`\", \"contributor\": \"lidezhu\", \"issue_number\": \"10918\", \"item\": \"TiCDC splits an `UPDATE` event into `DELETE` and `INSERT` events when using the MySQL sink\", \"related_entities\": [\"TiCDC\", \"Primary Key\", \"Unique Index\", \"commitTS\", \"thresholdTS\", \"PD\"]}], \"compatibility\": [\"SHOW MASTER STATUS output format is designed to match MySQL, but execution results differ.\", \"TiDB aims for full compatibility with MySQL\\'s SHOW WARNINGS\", \"DML statements like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE produce different execution plans compared to MySQL.\", \"JSON search result incompatibility exists when the result is NULL.\", \"The handling of units for Day and Time differs.\", \"SELECT CONNECTION_ID() returns a 32-bit integer\", \"Maintains Com_* counters\", \"Does not distinguish between TIMESTAMP and DATETIME in error messages, incorrectly converting TIMESTAMP to DATETIME\"], \"compatibility_with_tidb\": [\"TiDB\\'s auto-committed SELECT FOR UPDATE behavior\", \"TiDB\\'s TRUNCATE statement is designed to be fully compatible with MySQL\\'s implementation.\"], \"deprecated_statement\": \"SHOW BINARY LOG STATUS (deprecated in MySQL 8.2.0 and newer)\", \"details\": [{\"illegal_characters\": \"handled differently in read and write operations\"}, {\"description\": \"Improved Dumpling\\'s compatibility with MySQL versions 8.0.3 and 8.0.23, addressing issues related to incorrect `show table status` results.\", \"subtopic\": \"Dumpling compatibility with specific versions\"}, \"Can be a source or target database in the migration process.\", \"TLS can be enabled for the MySQL client.\", \"Host, port, user, password, and TLS settings are configured in DM.\", \"TLS settings include paths to client certificate, client key, and CA certificate within mounted Kubernetes Secrets.\", \"Often exhibits consistent result order due to single-threaded execution.\", \"Query plans can change with version upgrades, affecting result order.\"], \"example_databases\": [\"my_db1\", \"my_db2\"], \"extended_by\": \"TiDB\", \"features\": [\"Binlog support with various formats (ROW, STATEMENT, MIXED).\", \"Database-Level Replication and Binary Logging Options.\", \"Wildcard Character Support in `replicate-ild-do-table` and `replicate-wild-gnore-table`.\"], \"functions\": [\"BIN_TO_UUID()\", \"UUID_TO_BIN() (from version 8.0)\", \"UUID() (available in earlier versions)\"], \"github_issue\": \"8040\", \"host_configuration\": \"from.host\", \"impact_of_sql_mode\": \"sql_ode setting influences error/arning behavior in MySQL\", \"information_schema_for_temporary_tables\": true, \"instances\": [{\"database\": \"test_db\", \"source_id\": \"mysql-replica-01\", \"table\": \"test_table\"}, {\"database\": \"test_db\", \"source_id\": \"mysql-replica-02\", \"table\": \"test_table\"}], \"issue_number\": \"37481\", \"migration_tools\": [{\"method\": \"Full data migration\", \"tool\": \"dumpling\"}, {\"method\": \"Fast import for bulk data\", \"tool\": \"tidb-lightning\"}, {\"method\": \"Incremental replication\", \"tool\": \"TiDB-DM\"}], \"multiple_references_to_the_same_temporary_table\": false, \"note\": \"Different from TiDB\\'s default collations which are binary collations with suffix \\'_bin\\'.

These relationships connect the same source entity (TiDB, id: 720293) and target entity (MySQL, id: 540080).

Both describe compatibility between TiDB 7.4.0 and MySQL 8.0. Having these as separate relationships with different target entities (one pointing to \"MySQL 8.0\" and one to \"MySQL 8.0 Compatibility\") creates confusion about how these concepts relate.

Its description states: \"Improved compatibility between TiDB 7.4.0 and MySQL 8.0, facilitating smoother migrations and replications.\" This is better represented as a relationship between TiDB and MySQL 8.0 rather than as a separate entity. Additionally, there are already direct relationships between TiDB and MySQL 8.0 (IDs 38614 and 30066) that express compatibility aspects. Having this as a separate entity creates confusion about whether it represents a feature, a process, or a concept.\nconclusion: \"MySQL 8.0 Compatibility\" should not be represented as a standalone entity but rather as a relationship or attribute of the compatibility between TiDB and MySQL 8.0.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [39935]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The entity \"TiDB\" (id: 720293) has an extremely long description that contains many technical details, feature explanations, and version-specific information.

This makes it difficult to quickly understand the core concept of TiDB. A more concise description focusing on what TiDB is, with the technical details organized in the meta field or as separate related entities, would improve clarity.

The MySQL 8.0 entity (id: 660066) has \"NO_ENGINE_UBSTITUTION\" instead of \"NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION\" and \"ONLY_FULL_GROUP_ BY\" with an extra space.

This indicates that these entities have been flagged internally as needing revision. The TiDB entity description is extremely long and contains many technical details that might be better organized. The MySQL entity has inconsistent formatting in its metadata with mixed naming conventions (e.g., \"version_compatibility\" and \"version_ompatibility\").\nconclusion: These three main entities have been flagged for revision internally, suggesting known quality issues that need to be addressed.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [720293, 660066, 540080]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Relationship 38356 states \"TiDB 7.4.0 has enhanced compatibility with MySQL 8.0 Compatibility.\" This is problematic because the target entity \"MySQL 8.0 Compatibility\" is itself not a well-defined entity but rather a concept or feature as previously analyzed. This creates a circular reference where TiDB has compatibility with a \"compatibility\" entity, which is logically awkward.

Known issues include exiting when transporting a transaction greater than 1 GB and failures to send requests to Pump when the compressor is set to zip.

It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values.

All three relationships connect the same entities (TiDB → TiDB Community) and express the same fundamental concept - users asking TiDB-related questions in the community platform. The only difference is slight wording variation, but the core meaning remains the same.\nconclusion: Relationship 91091 is redundant with relationships 92243 and 50247 and should be merged with them.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: redundancy_relationship\naffected_ids: [91091, 92243, 50247]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Relationships 49710 \"The TiDB Community provides support for TiDB users\" and 50281 \"TiDB Community provides support for TiDB\" are nearly identical. Both express that the TiDB Community is a support mechanism for TiDB/TiDB users. The only minor difference is that one explicitly mentions \"TiDB users\" while the other just mentions \"TiDB,\" but in context, these convey the same relationship - that the community is a support resource.

This creates unnecessary redundancy in the graph. A more efficient structure would consolidate these into fewer, more precise relationships that capture the bidirectional nature of the interaction between TiDB users and the TiDB Community platform.\nconclusion: The knowledge graph contains excessive similar paths between TiDB and TiDB Community that could be consolidated for better efficiency.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: redundancy_relationship\naffected_ids: [49710, 91951, 92243, 92005, 91091, 50247, 49758, 50281, 49444]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: I've identified multiple relationships between TiDB and TiDB Community that express essentially the same concept. Specifically, relationships 91951, 92243, 91091, 50247, and 49758 all convey that \"Users can ask questions about TiDB on the TiDB Community forum\" with only slight wording variations. These relationships connect the same entities (TiDB and TiDB Community) and express identical semantic meaning - that TiDB users can use the community forum to ask questions.\nconclusion: These five relationships (91951, 92243, 91091, 50247, 49758) are semantically identical and should be merged into a single relationship.\nconfidence: very_high\nissue_type: redundancy_relationship\naffected_ids: [91951, 92243, 91091, 50247, 49758]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Relationship 92005 (\"TiDB Community is a place to ask questions about TiDB\") expresses the same concept as the first group of redundant relationships I identified (91951, 92243, 91091, 50247, 49758), but with the direction reversed. While the source and target entities are flipped, the semantic meaning remains the same - that users can ask TiDB questions in the TiDB Community.

However, the relationship description itself mentions both entities that are being connected, which makes the directionality somewhat unclear. The description includes two distinct actions (asking questions on community OR creating a support ticket), making it ambiguous which entity is performing which action. This description would be clearer if it explicitly stated how the TiDB Community relates to Support Tickets, such as \"TiDB Community offers alternative support options including Support Tickets.\"\nconclusion: Relationship 49864 has unclear expression due to the ambiguous connection between the entities and the inclusion of both entities in the description.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: relationship_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [49864]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The \"TiDB\" entity (ID: 720293) has a very long and detailed description that covers multiple aspects of the database system. While comprehensive, the description appears to be a collection of somewhat disconnected facts about TiDB rather than a cohesive description.

The tool handles various data sources such as CSV files, SQL files, and Parquet files, and integrates with cloud storage solutions like Amazon S3. Data integrity is ensured through mechanisms like global checksums and metadata coordination.\\n\\nKey features of TiDB Lightning include an optimized Scatter Region to batch mode for improved stability, a retry mechanism for restoring schemas, and the calculation of local checksums before sending data to TiKV Importer. Additionally, it enhances the performance of `ALTER TABLE` operations and leverages the Physical Import Mode through the `IMPORT INTO` statement.\\n\\nIn version v6.4.0, TiDB Lightning modified its behavior to handle files ending with uncompressed formats differently. In version v7.1.0, scheduling control behavior changed, introducing the `pause-pd-scheduler-scope` configuration parameter.

However, if the target cluster\\'s version is earlier than v6.1.0, an error occurs; in such cases, changing the parameter value to \"global\" allows retrying the operation.\\n\\nACID properties are guaranteed only after the entire import process completes. The tool has several advantages, including high performance data import, support for partitioned Raft KV, and a unified log format. It also addresses limitations such as concurrent DDL/DML operations during import and a parallel import limit of 10 Lightning instances maximum.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning includes configurations like `--tidb-port=4000`, `--pd-urls=127.0.0.1:2379`, `--backend=local`, `--sorted-kv-dir=/tmp/sorted-kvs`, and `-d \\'s3://{bucket}/{path}\\'`. Monitoring is supported through log files (`tidb-lightning.log`) and Grafana dashboards. The tool requires sufficient disk space for sorted KV files, more than 64 GiB of memory, and logical CPU cores for optimal performance.\\n\\nTiDB Lightning has been enhanced over versions, with notable fixes including potential out-of-range errors for auto-increment columns of `BIGINT` type (issue #27937) and connection failures to TiDB using IPv6 hosts (issue #35880).

Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\", 'meta': '{\"CTE behavior\": {\"details\": [\"Handles recursive CTE data length exceeding seed part with a warning in strict mode.\", \"Determines recursive CTE data type from the seed part.\", \"Allows \\'UNION\\' followed by \\'UNION ALL\\' with multiple UNION operators.\", \"Reports errors for problematic CTE definitions even if the CTE is not referenced.\"], \"status\": \"need-revised\"}, \"Version\": \"v4.0.4\", \"action\": \"Scans all partitions of table \\'t1\\'\", \"behavior\": [\"Performs an index range scan based on eq(test.t2.b, test.t1.b) when subquery decorrelation is disabled.\", \"always displays the complete numeric value\"], \"community\": \"Available support via community and tickets\", \"compatibility\": \"MySQL\", \"compatibility_change\": {\"description\": \"Changed the default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` from `2` to `1`.\"}, \"components\": [\"TiKV\", \"TiFlash\", \"TiCDC\", \"BR\", \"Dumpling/ Sqldump\", \"SQL parser\", \"SQL query optimizer\", \"SQL executor\", \"Server\"], \"date_formats\": [\"\\'YYYY- MM- DD\\' or \\'YY- MM- DD\\'\", \"\\'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\\' or \\'YYMMDDHHMMSS\\'\", \"YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS\"], \"decimal_ field_ modification\": {\"error\": \"ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision\"}, \"details\": [\"Converts `IN` subqueries to semi joins.\", \"Converts `= ANY` subqueries to left outer semi joins.\", \"Optimizes null-aware semi joins in `WHERE` clause to inner joins and aggregates.\", \"Handles null-aware semi joins by calculating Cartesian product and filtering.\", \"Use \\'SHOW BUILTINS\\' to list available functions.\", \"Supports most, but not all, MySQL built-in functions.\"], \"error_ handling\": {\"specific_errors\": [\"ErrWriteConflict\", \"ErrTxnRetryable\"]}, \"execution_plan_observation\": \"The provided execution plan details are from TiDB.\", \"features\": [\"MySQL Compatibility\", \"Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)\", \"Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)\", \"Online Unsafe Recovery\", \"Partition Pruning\", \"Optimizer Hints\", \"GBK Character Set Support\"], \"functionality\": \"Supports aggregate functions (including COUNT)\", \"interaction_details\": [\"Obtains TSOs from PD\", \"Communicates with PD for cluster management\"], \"memory_control\": {\"system_variable\": \"tidb_ mem_ quota_ query\"}, \"optimization\": \"Implements `tidb_opt_distinct_agg_push_down` for performance improvement.\", \"properties\": {\"Default Resource Group\": \"Provides a default resource group with unlimited resources\", \"Resource Allocation in Overcapacity\": \"Prioritizes resource groups with higher priority and allocates proportionally within same priority based on RU_PER_SEC\", \"Resource Control Metrics Collection\": \"Regularly collects runtime information about resource control\", \"Resource Control Metrics Visualization\": \"Provides visual charts in Grafana\\'s TiDB > Resource Control dashboard\", \"deployment_options\": [\"TiDB Self-Managed\", \"TiDB Cloud\"], \"monitoring_tool\": \"Grafana\", \"role\": \"Requests TSO from PD\", \"ttl_metrics_tables\": [\"mysql.tidb_ttl_table_status\", \"mysql.tidb_ttl_task\", \"mysql.tidb_ttl_job_history\"], \"type\": \"distributed SQL database\", \"uses\": \"PD Client to batch TSO requests\"}, \"reason\": \"Due to the non-sargable predicate\", \"source_descriptions\": [\"Derived from from relationship: TiDB Lightning -> TiDB Lightning imports data into TiDB.\", \"Derived from from relationship: TiDB Lightning -> TiDB Lightning imports data into TiDB clusters. -> TiDB\"], \"statement_summary_tables\": {\"description\": \"Provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL\\'s `events_statements_summary_by_digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1 and also provides statement summary tables in `information_schema`.\"}, \"status\": \"need-revised\", \"topic\": \"TiDB Enhancements\", \"type\": \"Distributed SQL database\"}'}, {'id': 48642, 'name': 'SHOW ENGINES statement', 'description': 'A SQL statement used to list all supported storage engines in TiDB.

Entity 32084 \"replication\" is described as \"Replication in TiDB refers to the process of maintaining multiple copies (replicas) of data across different TiKV nodes...\" with metadata showing the same configuration parameters. Both entities represent the same concept in TiDB - the replication configuration and process. Entity 32084 has a more detailed description but essentially covers the same concept, and even has the same configuration parameters in its metadata (max-replicas:3, enable-placement-rules:true, etc.). Additionally, entity 32084 has \"status\": \"need-verified\" in its metadata, suggesting it might need verification or consolidation.\nconclusion: Entities \"replication\" (ID 59758) and \"replication\" (ID 32084) represent the same concept and should be merged.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: redundancy_entity\naffected_ids: [59758, 32084]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Comparing entities with IDs 900513 (\"max-replicas\") and 33180 (\"Max Replicas\"), I find they refer to the same configuration parameter in TiDB. Entity 900513 describes \"max-replicas\" as \"a configuration parameter in a TiDB cluster that defines the maximum number of replicas for each Region\" while entity 33180 describes \"Max Replicas\" as \"The maximum number of replicas for a Raft group.\" Both refer to the same concept - the maximum number of replicas allowed in the system. The only differences are capitalization and description detail, but they fundamentally represent the same configuration parameter that controls replica count. Both entities are also connected to PD-related components in the relationships.\nconclusion: Entities \"max-replicas\" and \"Max Replicas\" represent the same configuration parameter and should be merged.\nconfidence: very_high\nissue_type: redundancy_entity\naffected_ids: [900513, 33180]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Entity 720294 (\"pd\") has a detailed description about the Placement Driver component in TiDB, covering its responsibilities, authentication methods, and various features. However, its metadata contains a \"status\": \"need-merged\" flag. This suggests that this entity might need to be merged with another entity, but there's no clear candidate for merging within the provided graph. The entity itself appears to be comprehensive and well-defined, but this status flag indicates a potential quality issue that needs resolution. Without knowing which entity it should be merged with, we cannot recommend a merge action, but should flag this for further review.\nconclusion: Entity \"pd\" has a \"need-merged\" status flag that requires attention, though no obvious merge candidate is present in the current graph.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [720294]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Entity 900513 \"max-replicas\" has \"status\": \"need-vised\" in its metadata. This appears to be a flag indicating the entity needs revision or supervision. The description is detailed and informative, explaining what max-replicas is and how it functions in TiDB. However, the \"need-vised\" flag suggests there might be quality concerns with this entity's definition that need to be addressed. This doesn't fall into obvious redundancy categories but relates to entity quality.\nconclusion: The \"max-replicas\" entity (ID 900513) has a quality flag in its metadata suggesting it needs revision.\nconfidence: moderate\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [900513]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The entity \"enable-placement-rules\" (ID 59765) has a very brief description that simply states \"Enables placement rules for controlling replica placement.\" This description is minimalistic and doesn't provide sufficient context about what placement rules are, their purpose, or how they affect the system. The metadata only includes the default value and a function that is essentially a restatement of the name. This lack of detail makes it difficult for users to understand the significance of this configuration option and how it relates to the broader replication system.\nconclusion: The \"enable-placement-rules\" entity has an insufficient description that lacks necessary context and details about its purpose and impact.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [59765]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Several entities related to replica management features have very similar patterns in their names and descriptions: \"enable-make-up-replica\" (ID 244653), \"enable-remove-extra-replica\" (ID 244654), and \"enable-remove-down-replica\" (ID 244223). These entities all follow the pattern of \"enable-[action]-replica\" and have descriptions that essentially restate their names without providing substantial information about how they work, when to use them, or their impact on the system. The descriptions are minimal and don't help users understand the nuances between these different features or how they interact with each other.\nconclusion: The replica management feature entities have overly simplistic descriptions that lack necessary context and details about their functionality and relationships.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [244653, 244654, 244223]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Entities with IDs 59758 and 32084 are both named \"replication\" but describe slightly different aspects. Entity 59758 focuses specifically on \"Configuration items related to replicas in PD\" with detailed configuration properties in its metadata. Entity 32084 provides a broader definition: \"Replication in TiDB refers to the process of maintaining multiple copies (replicas) of data across different TiKV nodes to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.\" The second entity also includes configuration parameters in its metadata. While they have some overlap, entity 59758 is specifically about configuration items, while entity 32084 describes the general concept and process. The metadata of entity 32084 contains a \"status\": \"need-verified\" flag, suggesting it requires verification. Since they represent different aspects (configuration vs. concept), merging them might lose important distinctions.\nconclusion: Entities represent different aspects of replication (configuration vs. concept) and should not be merged, but entity 32084 has a quality flag that needs attention.\nconfidence: moderate\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [32084]\n</analysis>\n", "system": "You are Graph-GPT, a knowledge graph expert.
