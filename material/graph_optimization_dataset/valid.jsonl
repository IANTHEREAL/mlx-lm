TiCDC is recommended as an alternative to TiDB Binlog starting from TiDB v7.5.0, offering improvements in memory consumption, alarm rules, redo log performance, and compatibility with Canal-JSON. It addresses several bugs related to schema handling, TiKV client resource maintenance, meta data cleanup, and prewrite event handling.\\n\\nTiCDC supports sending incremental data to Kafka in Avro format, dispatching data to different Kafka topics by table, and replicating charset=GBK tables starting from TiDB 6.1.0. It also supports SASL GSSAPI authentication types for secure data transmission. Additionally, TiCDC can be deployed on Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, utilizing Persistent Volumes (PVs) for storage. The tool is manageable via `cdc cli` and supports TLS starting from v4.0.3 with a default server port of 8301 when deployed through TiDB Operator.\\n\\nKey features include high availability through PD's etcd, data consistency using tidb_external_ts, support for multiple downstream platforms, and the ability to skip DDL statements for table attributes.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User → Purchased → Product and Customer → Ordered → Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User → Purchased in 2023 → Product and Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n    \n5. **Missing Meaningful Relationships**(missing_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: The absence of a direct relationship between two existing entities where such a relationship is critically important for the graph's completeness, coherence, or utility within its intended domain or application.\n  - Identification: This requires reasoning about the entities' nature and the graph's overall context. Identify pairs of entities where a direct link would represent a fundamental connection (e.g., [Company X] and [Product Y] developed by X; [Researcher A] and [Paper B] authored by A) and whose absence constitutes a significant gap.\n  - Constraint: Do not flag every possible indirect connection (e.g., if A→B and B→C exist, do not automatically assume A→C is missing unless that specific direct link has high semantic importance and utility). Focus on high-value, foundational missing links.\n\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a `<think>` section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue. Follow this with an `<answer>` section containing zero or more `<issue>` blocks.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2. `<answer>` Block: Contains a list of identified issues. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, this block must be empty or contain no `<issue>` tags.

Format must be exactly a comma-separated list within square brackets.\n</issue>\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs).

Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n- `missing_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly two entity IDs: `[source_entity_id, target_entity_id]`, representing the pair between which a critical relationship is missing.\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n<issue>\n... # follow output format\n</issue>\n... # other issue points\n</answer>\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User → Purchased → Product and Customer → Ordered → Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User → Purchased in 2023 → Product and Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n    \n5. **Missing Meaningful Relationships**(missing_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: The absence of a direct relationship between two existing entities where such a relationship is critically important for the graph's completeness, coherence, or utility within its intended domain or application.\n  - Identification: This requires reasoning about the entities' nature and the graph's overall context. Identify pairs of entities where a direct link would represent a fundamental connection (e.g., [Company X] and [Product Y] developed by X; [Researcher A] and [Paper B] authored by A) and whose absence constitutes a significant gap.\n  - Constraint: Do not flag every possible indirect connection (e.g., if A→B and B→C exist, do not automatically assume A→C is missing unless that specific direct link has high semantic importance and utility).

It is particularly useful after operations like dropping or truncating large amounts of data, which can leave behind many empty or small regions. By default enabled since TiDB v3.0, Region Merge triggers writing in-memory pessimistic locks to disk and replicates them to other replicas. However, it can also be controlled through the merge_option attribute, allowing administrators to set it to 'allow' or 'deny' as needed. The feature addresses issues like slow query performance post-deletion and handles scenarios involving large numbers of empty regions. While Region Merge offers significant benefits, it is not without risks; potential issues include panics and unexpected peer destruction if the target region is invalid or if the target peer is replaced with a destroyed peer.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User → Purchased → Product and Customer → Ordered → Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User → Purchased in 2023 → Product and Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n    \n5. **Missing Meaningful Relationships**(missing_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: The absence of a direct relationship between two existing entities where such a relationship is critically important for the graph's completeness, coherence, or utility within its intended domain or application.\n  - Identification: This requires reasoning about the entities' nature and the graph's overall context. Identify pairs of entities where a direct link would represent a fundamental connection (e.g., [Company X] and [Product Y] developed by X; [Researcher A] and [Paper B] authored by A) and whose absence constitutes a significant gap.\n  - Constraint: Do not flag every possible indirect connection (e.g., if A→B and B→C exist, do not automatically assume A→C is missing unless that specific direct link has high semantic importance and utility). Focus on high-value, foundational missing links.\n\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User → Purchased → Product and Customer → Ordered → Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User → Purchased in 2023 → Product and Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n    \n5. **Missing Meaningful Relationships**(missing_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: The absence of a direct relationship between two existing entities where such a relationship is critically important for the graph's completeness, coherence, or utility within its intended domain or application.\n  - Identification: This requires reasoning about the entities' nature and the graph's overall context. Identify pairs of entities where a direct link would represent a fundamental connection (e.g., [Company X] and [Product Y] developed by X; [Researcher A] and [Paper B] authored by A) and whose absence constitutes a significant gap.\n  - Constraint: Do not flag every possible indirect connection (e.g., if A→B and B→C exist, do not automatically assume A→C is missing unless that specific direct link has high semantic importance and utility).
