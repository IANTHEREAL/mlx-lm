to the same concept - configuration settings that apply globally to TiDB. The metadata for both contains overlapping variable names (e.g., tidb_hashagg_final_concurrency, tidb_hashagg_partial_concurrency).

The metadata for both includes information about scope (global/session), changeability, and persistence. The only difference is that \"TiDB System Variables\" explicitly includes \"TiDB\" in its name, but they clearly reference the same concept.\nconclusion: \"System Variables\" and \"TiDB System Variables\" represent the same concept and should be merged to eliminate redundancy.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: redundancy_entity\naffected_ids: [720088, 53926]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Examining the relationships between TiDB and variable entities, I found several redundant relationships:\nconclusion: These relationships are redundant and should be merged into a single relationship that clearly expresses how variables control TiDB's behavior.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: redundancy_relationship\naffected_ids: [46696, 46903, 46691, 47004]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Examining relationships ID 58625 (\"System variables can have a SESSION scope.\") and ID 1820 (\"System variables can be set at the SESSION scope.\"), I find they connect exactly the same entities - System Variables (720088) and SESSION Scope (363111).

While the relationships have slightly different wording, they effectively express the same semantic meaning from opposite directions. Having both relationships is redundant and potentially confusing as it suggests there are two distinct types of interactions between these entities when there is actually just one bidirectional relationship - TiDB is configured by these variables, and these variables affect TiDB's behavior.\nconclusion: The bidirectional relationships between TiDB and TiDB Global Variables are redundant and should be consolidated into a single, clearly defined bidirectional relationship or a single directional relationship that best represents the concept.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: redundancy_relationship\naffected_ids: [46696, 47004]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Examining relationships ID 46696 (\"These global variables affect the behavior of TiDB.\") and ID 46691 (\"TiDB uses specific global variables.\"), I find they connect exactly the same entities - TiDB (720293) and TiDB Global Variables (360702).

Since we've already identified that \"Global Variables\" and \"TiDB Global Variables\" are likely redundant entities, these relationships are also redundant.

The current description is overwhelming and makes it difficult to quickly understand what TiDB is at a high level. Additionally, the description contains many implementation details that may change over time, which could make the entity description outdated quickly.\nconclusion: The \"TiDB\" entity description is overly detailed, unfocused, and would benefit from being restructured to separate core information about what TiDB is from details about its components and features.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [720293]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The \"Global Scope\" (ID: 363113) entity description states \"Changes to GLOBAL variables apply immediately to all sessions.

The metadata also contains mixed messages, listing under \"effect\" that changes \"Apply immediately to all sessions\" but also \"Affect new sessions only.\"\nconclusion: The \"GLOBAL Scope\" entity contains contradictory information about how global variable changes affect existing sessions, creating confusion about the actual behavior.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [363113]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The entity \"Global Variables\" (ID: 49409) has a very brief description (\"Variables that affect the operation of the entire TiDB server.\") and limited metadata compared to other variable-related entities.

The description covers topics ranging from SQL features to deployment options, monitoring, data types, and integration with other components. This makes it difficult to understand what TiDB is at a fundamental level. The description lacks a clear structure and mixes implementation details with conceptual explanations. It mentions specific version numbers (e.g., \"v4.0.4\") and error messages (e.g., \"ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision\") that would be better suited for documentation than for an entity definition. The description also contains redundant information and some awkward phrasing, such as \"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency.\"\nconclusion: The TiDB entity description is overly complicated, poorly structured, and mixes too many concepts, making it difficult to understand the core purpose and definition of TiDB.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [720293]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Entity \"Data Migration (DM)\" (ID: 42766) has a brief description that lacks comprehensive information about the tool's functionality, components, and capabilities. While it mentions that it simplifies operations and automatically identifies change events, it doesn't explain the core purpose and functionality of DM as thoroughly as the other entities do. The description is limited to a few specific features and mentions \"Version 2.0.6 has been released\" which is a temporal detail that will become outdated. The metadata also contains minimal information compared to other entities. This contrasts with entity \"TiDB Data Migration (DM)\" (ID: 660106) which provides extensive details about functionality, components, limitations, and use cases.\nconclusion: Entity \"Data Migration (DM)\" has an incomplete and less informative description compared to other similar entities, making it less useful for understanding the concept.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [42766]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Entity \"TiDB Data Migration\" (ID: 900100) has a description that mixes the concept of data migration as a process with specific error handling procedures and commands. The description starts by defining data migration as a process but then shifts focus to error handling procedures like \"checking logs\" and using commands like \"binlog replace\" and \"query-status\". This creates confusion about whether this entity represents the general concept of data migration or specific operational procedures. The description also mentions \"challenges can arise with unsupported DDL operations\" without explaining what these challenges are or how they relate to the broader concept of data migration. This makes the entity description inconsistent and less focused compared to other entities like \"TiDB Data Migration (DM)\" (ID: 660106) which clearly defines what the tool is and what it does.\nconclusion: Entity \"TiDB Data Migration\" has an inconsistent description that mixes conceptual definition with operational procedures, making it unclear what aspect of data migration it represents.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [900100]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: I examined the relationship with ID 240252 that states \"DM is a tool for migrating data into TiDB.\" However, this relationship connects \"Data Migration\" (ID: 363057) to \"DM\" (ID: 510090), rather than connecting either of these to TiDB. This is confusing because the relationship text implies a connection to TiDB, but the actual entities connected are two variations of the DM concept. This creates an inconsistency between the relationship text and the entities being connected. It appears this relationship is trying to explain that the general concept of \"Data Migration\" is implemented through the specific \"DM\" tool, but the wording suggests something different.\nconclusion: The relationship between \"Data Migration\" and \"DM\" has an unclear expression that doesn't match the entities being connected.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: relationship_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [240252]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Relationship ID 54811 connects \"TiDB Data Migration\" (ID: 900100) to \"TiDB Data Migration (DM)\" (ID: 660106) with the statement \"TiDB data migration is performed using the DM platform.\" This relationship is confusing because it connects two entities that essentially represent the same concept - they're both about TiDB's data migration capabilities. The relationship text suggests that one is a process and the other is a tool, but this distinction is not clearly made in the entity descriptions. Since these entities should likely be merged as part of addressing the redundant entities issue, this relationship would become unnecessary.\nconclusion: The relationship between \"TiDB Data Migration\" and \"TiDB Data Migration (DM)\" is redundant and unclear, connecting two entities that represent the same concept.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: relationship_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [54811]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: I analyzed relationship ID 54393, which states \"DM replicates DML events.\" This relationship connects \"TiDB Data Migration (DM)\" (ID: 660106) to \"DML\" (ID: 660207). While it's true that a data migration tool would handle DML operations, this relationship doesn't fully capture the nature of the interaction. DM doesn't just replicate DML events - it captures, transforms, and applies various types of database changes, including both DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML operations. The current relationship text is too narrow and doesn't clearly express how DM processes DML operations as part of its broader data migration functionality. Additionally, the relationship would be more informative if it explained that DM captures DML events from the source database and applies them to the target database.\nconclusion: The relationship between \"TiDB Data Migration (DM)\" and \"DML\" has an unclear and incomplete expression that doesn't fully capture how DM handles DML operations.\nconfidence: moderate\nissue_type: relationship_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [54393]\n</analysis>\n", "system": "You are Graph-GPT, a knowledge graph expert.

It is supported by both TiKV and TiFlash. The TopN Operator is involved in optimization considerations, such as pushdown to coprocessors and join operations, with specific rules for Inner and Outer Joins. Pushdown is possible only when the sorting rule exclusively depends on columns on the outer table.

Both relationships express the same semantic connection between the same entities.

TiFlash is optimized for OLAP workloads and supports Massively Parallel Processing (MPP) to accelerate complex analytical queries. It can be deployed in both coupled and disaggregated storage and compute architectures, with support for storage backends like Amazon S3. TiFlash supports various query optimizations, including data compaction, distinct optimization, and spilling intermediate data to disk. It is compatible with TiDB and TiSpark, and its performance can be tuned via system variables. TiFlash is recommended for isolating OLAP workloads from OLTP workloads, providing physical isolation on the storage layer and consistent reads. It supports multi-disk deployment and can execute window functions, joins, and aggregations efficiently.

{"prompt": "Optimize the following graph:\n{'entities': [{'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB', 'description': \"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\", 'meta': '{\"CTE behavior\": {\"details\": [\"Handles recursive CTE data length exceeding seed part with a warning in strict mode.\", \"Determines recursive CTE data type from the seed part.\", \"Allows \\'UNION\\' followed by \\'UNION ALL\\' with multiple UNION operators.\", \"Reports errors for problematic CTE definitions even if the CTE is not referenced.\"], \"status\": \"need-revised\"}, \"Version\": \"v4.0.4\", \"action\": \"Scans all partitions of table \\'t1\\'\", \"behavior\": [\"Performs an index range scan based on eq(test.t2.b, test.t1.b) when subquery decorrelation is disabled.\", \"always displays the complete numeric value\"], \"community\": \"Available support via community and tickets\", \"compatibility\": \"MySQL\", \"compatibility_change\": {\"description\": \"Changed the default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` from `2` to `1`.\"}, \"components\": [\"TiKV\", \"TiFlash\", \"TiCDC\", \"BR\", \"Dumpling/ Sqldump\", \"SQL parser\", \"SQL query optimizer\", \"SQL executor\", \"Server\"], \"date_formats\": [\"\\'YYYY- MM- DD\\' or \\'YY- MM- DD\\'\", \"\\'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\\' or \\'YYMMDDHHMMSS\\'\", \"YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS\"], \"decimal_ field_ modification\": {\"error\": \"ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision\"}, \"details\": [\"Converts `IN` subqueries to semi joins.\", \"Converts `= ANY` subqueries to left outer semi joins.\", \"Optimizes null-aware semi joins in `WHERE` clause to inner joins and aggregates.\", \"Handles null-aware semi joins by calculating Cartesian product and filtering.\", \"Use \\'SHOW BUILTINS\\' to list available functions.\", \"Supports most, but not all, MySQL built-in functions.\"], \"error_ handling\": {\"specific_errors\": [\"ErrWriteConflict\", \"ErrTxnRetryable\"]}, \"execution_plan_observation\": \"The provided execution plan details are from TiDB.\", \"features\": [\"MySQL Compatibility\", \"Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)\", \"Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)\", \"Online Unsafe Recovery\", \"Partition Pruning\", \"Optimizer Hints\", \"GBK Character Set Support\"], \"functionality\": \"Supports aggregate functions (including COUNT)\", \"interaction_details\": [\"Obtains TSOs from PD\", \"Communicates with PD for cluster management\"], \"memory_control\": {\"system_variable\": \"tidb_ mem_ quota_ query\"}, \"optimization\": \"Implements `tidb_opt_distinct_agg_push_down` for performance improvement.\", \"properties\": {\"Default Resource Group\": \"Provides a default resource group with unlimited resources\", \"Resource Allocation in Overcapacity\": \"Prioritizes resource groups with higher priority and allocates proportionally within same priority based on RU_PER_SEC\", \"Resource Control Metrics Collection\": \"Regularly collects runtime information about resource control\", \"Resource Control Metrics Visualization\": \"Provides visual charts in Grafana\\'s TiDB > Resource Control dashboard\", \"deployment_options\": [\"TiDB Self-Managed\", \"TiDB Cloud\"], \"monitoring_tool\": \"Grafana\", \"role\": \"Requests TSO from PD\", \"ttl_metrics_tables\": [\"mysql.tidb_ttl_table_status\", \"mysql.tidb_ttl_task\", \"mysql.tidb_ttl_job_history\"], \"type\": \"distributed SQL database\", \"uses\": \"PD Client to batch TSO requests\"}, \"reason\": \"Due to the non-sargable predicate\", \"source_descriptions\": [\"Derived from from relationship: TiDB Lightning -> TiDB Lightning imports data into TiDB.\", \"Derived from from relationship: TiDB Lightning -> TiDB Lightning imports data into TiDB clusters. -> TiDB\"], \"statement_summary_tables\": {\"description\": \"Provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL\\'s `events_statements_summary_by_digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1 and also provides statement summary tables in `information_schema`.\"}, \"status\": \"need-revised\", \"topic\": \"TiDB Enhancements\", \"type\": \"Distributed SQL database\"}'}, {'id': 660067, 'name': 'MySQL Compatibility', 'description': 'TiDB is designed to be highly compatible with MySQL, supporting a wide range of features and syntax.

They share the same core functionalities: timestamp allocation (TSO), region scheduling, data placement management, and metadata management. Both mention similar deployment characteristics, monitoring capabilities, and integration with other components like TiKV and TiDB. While entity 362888 has more detailed metadata, the fundamental concept, role, and functions are identical between these entities.

{"prompt": "Optimize the following graph:\n{'entities': [{'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB', 'description': \"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values.

{"prompt": "Optimize the following graph:\n{'entities': [{'id': 720293, 'name': 'TiDB', 'description': \"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\", 'meta': '{\"CTE behavior\": {\"details\": [\"Handles recursive CTE data length exceeding seed part with a warning in strict mode.\", \"Determines recursive CTE data type from the seed part.\", \"Allows \\'UNION\\' followed by \\'UNION ALL\\' with multiple UNION operators.\", \"Reports errors for problematic CTE definitions even if the CTE is not referenced.\"], \"status\": \"need-revised\"}, \"Version\": \"v4.0.4\", \"action\": \"Scans all partitions of table \\'t1\\'\", \"behavior\": [\"Performs an index range scan based on eq(test.t2.b, test.t1.b) when subquery decorrelation is disabled.\", \"always displays the complete numeric value\"], \"community\": \"Available support via community and tickets\", \"compatibility\": \"MySQL\", \"compatibility_change\": {\"description\": \"Changed the default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` from `2` to `1`.\"}, \"components\": [\"TiKV\", \"TiFlash\", \"TiCDC\", \"BR\", \"Dumpling/ Sqldump\", \"SQL parser\", \"SQL query optimizer\", \"SQL executor\", \"Server\"], \"date_formats\": [\"\\'YYYY- MM- DD\\' or \\'YY- MM- DD\\'\", \"\\'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS\\' or \\'YYMMDDHHMMSS\\'\", \"YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS\"], \"decimal_ field_ modification\": {\"error\": \"ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision\"}, \"details\": [\"Converts `IN` subqueries to semi joins.\", \"Converts `= ANY` subqueries to left outer semi joins.\", \"Optimizes null-aware semi joins in `WHERE` clause to inner joins and aggregates.\", \"Handles null-aware semi joins by calculating Cartesian product and filtering.\", \"Use \\'SHOW BUILTINS\\' to list available functions.\", \"Supports most, but not all, MySQL built-in functions.\"], \"error_ handling\": {\"specific_errors\": [\"ErrWriteConflict\", \"ErrTxnRetryable\"]}, \"execution_plan_observation\": \"The provided execution plan details are from TiDB.\", \"features\": [\"MySQL Compatibility\", \"Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)\", \"Cost-Based Optimization (CBO)\", \"Online Unsafe Recovery\", \"Partition Pruning\", \"Optimizer Hints\", \"GBK Character Set Support\"], \"functionality\": \"Supports aggregate functions (including COUNT)\", \"interaction_details\": [\"Obtains TSOs from PD\", \"Communicates with PD for cluster management\"], \"memory_control\": {\"system_variable\": \"tidb_ mem_ quota_ query\"}, \"optimization\": \"Implements `tidb_opt_distinct_agg_push_down` for performance improvement.\", \"properties\": {\"Default Resource Group\": \"Provides a default resource group with unlimited resources\", \"Resource Allocation in Overcapacity\": \"Prioritizes resource groups with higher priority and allocates proportionally within same priority based on RU_PER_SEC\", \"Resource Control Metrics Collection\": \"Regularly collects runtime information about resource control\", \"Resource Control Metrics Visualization\": \"Provides visual charts in Grafana\\'s TiDB > Resource Control dashboard\", \"deployment_options\": [\"TiDB Self-Managed\", \"TiDB Cloud\"], \"monitoring_tool\": \"Grafana\", \"role\": \"Requests TSO from PD\", \"ttl_metrics_tables\": [\"mysql.tidb_ttl_table_status\", \"mysql.tidb_ttl_task\", \"mysql.tidb_ttl_job_history\"], \"type\": \"distributed SQL database\", \"uses\": \"PD Client to batch TSO requests\"}, \"reason\": \"Due to the non-sargable predicate\", \"source_descriptions\": [\"Derived from from relationship: TiDB Lightning -> TiDB Lightning imports data into TiDB.\", \"Derived from from relationship: TiDB Lightning -> TiDB Lightning imports data into TiDB clusters. -> TiDB\"], \"statement_summary_tables\": {\"description\": \"Provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL\\'s `events_statements_summary_by_digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1 and also provides statement summary tables in `information_schema`.\"}, \"status\": \"need-revised\", \"topic\": \"TiDB Enhancements\", \"type\": \"Distributed SQL database\"}'}, {'id': 31982, 'name': 'enable_binlog', 'description': 'A configuration parameter to enable the binlog service.', 'meta': '{\"default_value\": false, \"description\": \"Enables the binlog service.\", \"purpose\": \"Enable binlog service\", \"topic\": \"enable_binlog\"}'}, {'id': 660177, 'name': 'Binlog', 'description': \"A binary log, commonly referred to as 'binlog', is a crucial component in databases like MySQL and TiDB.

This creates ambiguity because it doesn't clearly distinguish between generic binary logs and TiDB's specific implementation. While it mentions TiDB in parts, it intermixes information about MySQL binlogs and general binlog concepts. This makes it difficult for users to understand which parts specifically apply to TiDB's implementation versus generic binlog concepts or MySQL's implementation.

For example, it mentions \"TiDB Binlog is a component of the TiDB ecosystem designed for capturing...\" without immediately clarifying its deprecated status. Additionally, the meta data contains \"supported: true\" which contradicts the deprecation information. This inconsistency could confuse users about whether they should be using this component in current TiDB deployments.\nconclusion: Entity \"TiDB Binlog\" contains contradictory information about its deprecation status, creating inconsistency in the entity description.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [660095]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The \"TiDB Cluster\" entity (ID 660151) mentions \"Pump\" and \"Drainer\" as components in its meta data, which are parts of TiDB Binlog. However, the entity description doesn't clearly explain that these components are specifically part of the deprecated TiDB Binlog system. Since TiDB Binlog is being deprecated (as noted in entity 660095), having these components listed without this context in the TiDB Cluster description could mislead users into thinking they're still core recommended components.

The description jumps between different topics without a clear logical flow. A more structured description that starts with a concise definition of what TiDB is, followed by organized sections covering key features, architecture, and other important aspects would improve clarity and usability.\nconclusion: The description of the \"TiDB\" entity is excessively detailed and poorly structured, making it difficult to quickly grasp the fundamental nature of TiDB.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [720293]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The entities \"enable_binlog\" (ID: 31982) and \"enable-binlog\" (ID: 1223) have very similar names but represent different concepts. \"enable_binlog\" is described as \"A configuration parameter to enable the binlog service\" while \"enable-binlog\" is described as \"Enables or disables TiDB binlog generation.\" The difference is subtle but important - one is a configuration parameter and the other is a command-line flag (as indicated by the hyphen notation typically used for command-line options). This distinction is not clearly communicated in the descriptions, which could lead to confusion. The descriptions should be enhanced to clearly state the difference between these two entities and their specific usage contexts.\nconclusion: The entities \"enable_binlog\" and \"enable-binlog\" have ambiguous descriptions that do not clearly distinguish their different purposes and usage contexts.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [31982, 1223]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Looking at the entity \"enable_binlog\" (31982), its description is quite brief: \"A configuration parameter to enable the binlog service.\" The meta information includes a default value of false, a description \"Enables the binlog service,\" and a purpose \"Enable binlog service.\" This is somewhat redundant and doesn't provide much context about what the binlog service is, how it relates to TiDB Binlog, or its implications. Given the importance of this parameter and its relationship to TiDB Binlog (which is now deprecated), more context would be valuable, such as mentioning the deprecation status of TiDB Binlog and recommended alternatives.\nconclusion: The \"enable_binlog\" entity has a vague description that lacks important context about its relationship to TiDB Binlog and the implications of enabling it.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [31982]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The relationship descriptions for IDs 44427 and 44428 are nearly identical. Relationship 44427 states \"TiDB Binlog is incompatible with the tidb_enable_async_commit system variable\" and relationship 44428 states \"TiDB Binlog is incompatible with the tidb_enable_1pc system variable\". While they refer to different target entities (different system variables), the relationship descriptions are nearly identical and don't explain why the incompatibility exists or what happens if both are enabled. This is important information for users. A better description would include the consequence of enabling both features or explain the nature of the incompatibility.\nconclusion: Relationships describing TiDB Binlog incompatibilities with system variables lack essential meaning about the nature of the incompatibility.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: relationship_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [44427, 44428]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The relationship with ID 44353 states \"TiDB Binlog is enabled on TiDB instances.\" This statement is ambiguous and potentially misleading as it suggests that TiDB Binlog is enabled by default on all TiDB instances, which contradicts other information in the graph. The relationship doesn't clearly express that TiDB Binlog is a component that can be optionally enabled on TiDB instances, rather than being enabled by default. A more precise relationship would clarify that TiDB Binlog can be enabled on TiDB instances through configuration parameters.\nconclusion: The relationship \"TiDB Binlog is enabled on TiDB instances\" is ambiguous and should be rephrased to more clearly express the optional nature of enabling TiDB Binlog.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: relationship_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [44353]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: Examining relationships ID 41530, 42485, and 242182 between TiDB Binlog and TiDB, I notice they all describe essentially the same relationship but with slightly different wording: \"TiDB Binlog collects and replicates TiDB's binlog,\" \"TiDB Binlog is a tool associated with TiDB 3.0.6,\" and \"TiDB Binlog is a tool in TiDB 5.1.4 that has received bug fixes in this release.\" While these relationships mention different TiDB versions, they all fundamentally express that TiDB Binlog is a tool or component that works with TiDB. The version-specific information could be better represented in the entity metadata rather than as separate relationships that essentially convey the same core connection between these entities.\nconclusion: These three relationships between TiDB Binlog and TiDB are redundant and should be consolidated into a single relationship that clearly states TiDB Binlog is a component/tool of TiDB.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: redundancy_relationship\naffected_ids: [41530, 42485, 242182]\n</analysis>\n", "system": "You are Graph-GPT, a knowledge graph expert.

While comprehensive, this approach makes the information difficult to consume and navigate. The description would benefit from organization into clear sections covering different aspects of TiDB rather than a single monolithic paragraph. Additionally, some of the information appears to be release-specific and could be separated into version notes.\nconclusion: The TiDB entity description is overly complex and poorly organized, making it difficult for users to extract relevant information.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: entity_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [720293]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The relationship with ID 41663 states \"TiDB 2.1 RC1 handled the mismatchClusterID issue.\" This relationship connects TiDB (ID 720293) to mismatchClusterID Issue (ID 43685). While it indicates that some issue was fixed, it fails to provide any meaningful information about how the issue was addressed, what the root cause was, or what symptoms users might observe. Without these details, the relationship provides very limited value. Users cannot determine if their issue is the same one that was fixed or understand the nature of the fix.\nconclusion: The relationship \"TiDB 2.1 RC1 handled the mismatchClusterID issue\" lacks essential meaning about the nature of the issue and how it was handled.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: relationship_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [41663]\n</analysis>\n\n<analysis>\nreasoning: The relationship with ID 2347 states \"The troubleshooting guide is for TiDB clusters.\" This relationship connects entity 3095 \"TiDB Cluster Troubleshooting Guide\" to entity 720293 \"TiDB\" rather than to entity 660151 \"TiDB Cluster\".\nconclusion: The relationship between the troubleshooting guide and TiDB is imprecise - it should connect to the TiDB Cluster entity instead to accurately reflect the guide's scope.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: relationship_quality_issue\naffected_ids: [2347]\n</analysis>\n", "system": "You are Graph-GPT, a knowledge graph expert. Your task is to analyze the knowledge graph and propose refinement actions that improve graph quality while preserving knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n- **Non-redundant**: No duplicate entities or relationships\n- **Coherent**: Relationships and entities form a logical structure\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous descriptions\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge is correct\n- **Efficiently connected**: Important relationships exist without excessive similar paths\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**\n  - Definition: Multiple entities that represent the same real-world entity (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Obvious similarity in names, descriptions, and metadata.\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**\n  - Definition: Multiple relationships connecting the same (or nearly identical) source and target entity pair, with identical semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Identical (or nearly identical) source/target entities and identical relationship description.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User → Purchased → Product and Customer → Ordered → Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User → Purchased in 2023 → Product and Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product.\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**\n  - Definition: Flaws in entity definitions or descriptions that reduce clarity, accuracy, or usability.\n  - Subtypes:\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contradictory or conflicting attributes (e.g., User labeled as both \"Active\" and \"Deleted\").\n    - Meaningless Descriptions: Vague, unclear, or non-specific text (e.g., \"Entity related to something\").\n    - Ambiguous Description: Applies to multiple concepts or lacks specificity (e.g., \"A system that manages data\").\n    - Overly General: Lacks specific details or fails to distinguish between different instances (e.g., \"A database system\").\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**\n  - Definition: Flaws in relationship definitions that obscure their purpose or logic.\n  - Subtypes:\n    - Unclear Expression: Relationships poorly defined (e.g., \"connected to\" without context).\n    - Missing Essential Meaning: Fails to unambiguously describe the connection between entities.\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n\n# Supported Action (Only select from the following actions)\n\n1. **merge_entities** - Merge redundant entities\n2. **merge_relationships** - Merge redundant relationships\n3. **flag_entity_quality_issue** - Highlight entity quality issues\n4. **flag_relationship_quality_issue** - Highlight relationship quality issues\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis should be thorough, and your final output must strictly follow this format:\n\n1.
