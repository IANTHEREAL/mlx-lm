Your task is to analyze the knowledge graph and identify and describe issues within the knowledge graph to facilitate quality improvements while preserving knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n- **Non-redundant**: No duplicate entities or relationships\n- **Coherent**: Relationships and entities form a logical structure\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous descriptions\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge is correct\n- **Efficiently connected**: Ensuring optimal pathways between related entities, and avoiding unnecessary redundant connections.\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**\n  - Definition: Multiple entities that represent the same real-world entity (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Obvious similarity in names, and descriptions.\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**\n  - Definition: Multiple relationships connecting the same (or nearly identical) source and target entity pair, with identical semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Identical (or nearly identical) source/target entities and identical relationship description.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User → Purchased → Product and Customer → Ordered → Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User → Purchased in 2023 → Product and Customer → Purchased 2024 → Product.\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**\n  - Definition: Flaws in entity definitions or descriptions that reduce clarity, accuracy, or usability.\n  - Subtypes:\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contradictory or conflicting attributes (e.g., User labeled as both \"Active\" and \"Deleted\").\n    - Meaningless Descriptions: Vague, unclear, or non-specific text (e.g., \"Entity related to something\").\n    - Ambiguous Description: Applies to multiple concepts or lacks specificity (e.g., \"A system that manages data\").\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**\n  - Definition: Flaws in relationship definitions that obscure their purpose or logic.\n  - Subtypes:\n    - Unclear Expression: Relationships poorly defined (e.g., \"connected to\" without context).\n    - Missing Essential Meaning: Fails to unambiguously describe the connection between entities.\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n\n5. **Missing Meaningful Relationships**\n  - Definition: The absence of a direct relationship between two existing entities where such a relationship would significantly improve the graph's completeness, coherence, or utility.\n  - Identification: Requires reasoning about the entities' nature and the graph's context to determine if a high-value connection is missing.\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis should be thorough, and your final output must strictly follow this format:\n\n1. Begin with <think>...</think> section where you should include all your graph analysis and reflections in detail.\n2. Follow with <answer>...</answer> section containing a list of issues. Each identified problem should be described within an `<issue>` tag, using the following structure (only this structure is available):\n\n<issue>\nreasoning: Provide a summary of your analysis from the think section that led to identifying this issue. (Be concise but capture the essential justification from your `<think>` analysis.)\nconfidence: [low|moderate|high|very_high], the confidence level of your analysis and conclusion\nfacto_search: (Optional) Specific information that should be verified externally.\nissue_type: [redundancy_entity|redundancy_relationship|entity_quality_issue|relationship_quality_issue|missing_relationship]\naffected_ids: [List of entity_ids or relationship_ids affected by this issue, specific meaning depends on issue_type]\n</issue>\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n<answer>\n<issue>\nreasoning: Entity \"Machine Learning\" (entity_id1) has description: \"A field of AI focused on algorithms that learn from data patterns.\" Entity \"ML\" (entity_id2) has description: \"A branch of artificial intelligence where systems learn from data.\" Both refer to the same concept, position it as a subset of AI, and focus on learning from data as the core functionality. No contradictory information exists between them.\nconfidence: high\nissue_type: redundancy_entity\naffected_ids: [entity_id1, entity_id2]\n</issue>\n... # other issue points\n</answer>\n\n## Issue Type Details\nThe `issue_type` field must be one of the following: `redundancy_entity`, `redundancy_relationship`, `entity_quality_issue`, `relationship_quality_issue`, `missing_relationship`.\nThe `affected_ids` field interpretation depends on the `issue_type`:\n- **redundancy_entity**: `affected_ids` contains IDs of redundant entities.\n- **redundancy_relationship**: `affected_ids` contains IDs of redundant relationships.\n- **entity_quality_issue**: `affected_ids` contains the ID of the entity with a quality issue.\n- **relationship_quality_issue**: `affected_ids` contains the ID of the relationship with a quality issue.\n- **missing_relationship**: `affected_ids` contains exactly two entity IDs: `[source_entity_id, target_entity_id]` between which a meaningful relationship is identified as missing.\n\n**Important**: If no redundancy, quality issues, or missing meaningful relationships are identified after thorough analysis, the `<answer>` section must be empty or contain no `<issue>` tags.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.\n"}
