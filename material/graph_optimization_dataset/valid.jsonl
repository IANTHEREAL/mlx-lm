Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 74, "id": "0965ddf0-c17d-4ce6-ac8c-c50abd7f50a9"}}

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 75, "id": "0965ddf0-c17d-4ce6-ac8c-c50abd7f50a9"}}

They are managed by the Placement Driver (PD) and can be dynamically split or merged to balance load, improve performance, and manage data distribution across the cluster. Each Region has multiple replicas, including one leader and several followers. Data changes on the leader are synchronously updated to all followers, ensuring consistency across replicas. Regions facilitate efficient data handling by allowing transactions that involve only a single Region to benefit from a one-ase commit process. Multiple Regions can exist within a single partition, with each partition typically containing five Regionsâ€”four for row data and one for index data.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format.

MySQL supports multiple versions including 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0, with experimental support for MySQL 8.0 on TiDB Cloud. It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID(). Some functions, such as UUID_TO_BIN() and UUID(), are available from version 8.0 onwards. The system typically uses general collations with suffixes like '_general_ci' or '_ai_ci', which differs from TiDB's default binary collations. MySQL is compatible with TiDB version 8.0.30, supporting functions like STATEMENT_DIGEST() and STATEMENT_DIGEST_TEXT(), but SM3() is not supported.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 78, "id": "0807b83a-8220-4808-805e-1d4cf3fede89"}}

It is compatible with several migration tools such as Dumpling, tidb-lightning, and TiDB-DM, and offers features like binlog replication in ROW format for data consistency. While MySQL aims to provide high compatibility with systems like TiDB, there are differences in areas such as JSON search results, handling of NULL values, execution plans, and certain SQL syntax elements. MySQL also supports various index types (HASH, BTREE, RTREE), full-text search with limited index support, and maintains specific behaviors for statements like EXPLAIN FOR CONNECTION. It is often used as a downstream database in replication scenarios and provides a set of functions for manipulating and retrieving date and time data. MySQL includes TiDB extensions such as ADMIN CHECK, ADMIN CLEANUP INDEX, and ADMIN RECOVER INDEX statements. The system variables effectively manage internal temporary tables, but it doesn't allow multiple references to the same temporary table. InnoDB is the default storage engine. MySQL's syntax is extended by TiDB with the ADMIN statement. It supports UUIDs and related functions like BIN_TO_UUID(), UUID_TO_BIN(), and UUID().

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```).

Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 130, "id": "459f65c5-6671-4eae-bc41-16ff4e5b8aa4"}}

It supports real-time data replication by capturing changes from TiDB transaction logs and replicating them using protocols such as Canal-JSON, Avro, and open-protocol. TiCDC is recommended as an alternative to TiDB Binlog starting from TiDB v7.5.0, offering improvements in memory consumption, alarm rules, redo log performance, and compatibility with Canal-JSON. It addresses several bugs related to schema handling, TiKV client resource maintenance, meta data cleanup, and prewrite event handling.\\n\\nTiCDC supports sending incremental data to Kafka in Avro format, dispatching data to different Kafka topics by table, and replicating charset=GBK tables starting from TiDB 6.1.0. It also supports SASL GSSAPI authentication types for secure data transmission. Additionally, TiCDC can be deployed on Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, utilizing Persistent Volumes (PVs) for storage. The tool is manageable via `cdc cli` and supports TLS starting from v4.0.3 with a default server port of 8301 when deployed through TiDB Operator.\\n\\nKey features include high availability through PD's etcd, data consistency using tidb_external_ts, support for multiple downstream platforms, and the ability to skip DDL statements for table attributes. It also supports batch UPDATE DML statements and is incompatible with `IMPORT INTO`. It is recommended to use TiCDC with `sql_require_primary_key` enabled.\\n\\nTiCDC includes a tool in TiDB 4.0.13 that implements processor flow control to avoid memory overflow and supports cleaning up stale temporary files. A significant change is the deprecation of `--sort-Dir` in the `cdc cli changefeed` command; users should now set `--sort-Dir` in the `cdc server` command. Before v4.0.3, when restoring tables using BR, it's crucial to add tables to the block list using the `filter.rules` configuration to prevent unexpected DDL executions on the restored tables.\\n\\nLimitations include issues with multi-valued indexes before v6.6.0 and DDL operations within imported SQL statements.\"}, {'id': 660151, 'name': 'TiDB Cluster', 'description': \"A distributed NewSQL database system designed for high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 131, "id": "459f65c5-6671-4eae-bc41-16ff4e5b8aa4"}}

It supports real-time data replication by capturing changes from TiDB transaction logs and replicating them using protocols such as Canal-JSON, Avro, and open-protocol. TiCDC is recommended as an alternative to TiDB Binlog starting from TiDB v7.5.0, offering improvements in memory consumption, alarm rules, redo log performance, and compatibility with Canal-JSON. It addresses several bugs related to schema handling, TiKV client resource maintenance, meta data cleanup, and prewrite event handling.\\n\\nTiCDC supports sending incremental data to Kafka in Avro format, dispatching data to different Kafka topics by table, and replicating charset=GBK tables starting from TiDB 6.1.0. It also supports SASL GSSAPI authentication types for secure data transmission. Additionally, TiCDC can be deployed on Kubernetes using TiDB Operator, utilizing Persistent Volumes (PVs) for storage. The tool is manageable via `cdc cli` and supports TLS starting from v4.0.3 with a default server port of 8301 when deployed through TiDB Operator.\\n\\nKey features include high availability through PD's etcd, data consistency using tidb_external_ts, support for multiple downstream platforms, and the ability to skip DDL statements for table attributes. It also supports batch UPDATE DML statements and is incompatible with `IMPORT INTO`. It is recommended to use TiCDC with `sql_require_primary_key` enabled.\\n\\nTiCDC includes a tool in TiDB 4.0.13 that implements processor flow control to avoid memory overflow and supports cleaning up stale temporary files. A significant change is the deprecation of `--sort-Dir` in the `cdc cli changefeed` command; users should now set `--sort-Dir` in the `cdc server` command. Before v4.0.3, when restoring tables using BR, it's crucial to add tables to the block list using the `filter.rules` configuration to prevent unexpected DDL executions on the restored tables.\\n\\nLimitations include issues with multi-valued indexes before v6.6.0 and DDL operations within imported SQL statements.\"}, {'id': 660151, 'name': 'TiDB Cluster', 'description': \"A distributed NewSQL database system designed for high availability, scalability, and disaster recovery.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 132, "id": "459f65c5-6671-4eae-bc41-16ff4e5b8aa4"}}

GC can be enabled or disabled using specific commands ('SET GLOBAL tidb_gc_enable=TRUE'/'FALSE') and its status verified through 'SELECT @@global.tidb_gc_enable'.

Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 195, "id": "ef31a0ec-1802-41ba-ba72-8b3761add834"}}

Increasing this variable can prevent data loss during replication tasks but may also increase storage usage and impact performance, especially for range queries.

It uses a safe point, calculated as the current time minus the GC life time, to determine which data can be safely deleted. The process involves several steps including Resolve Locks, Delete Ranges, and leverages RocksDB's compaction filter for efficient data removal. GC operates in DISTRIBUTED mode by default since TiDB 3.0, with older versions using CENTRAL mode. It interacts with components like TiFlash (affecting CMSketch memory allocation) and TiCDC (removing replicated history data). GC can be enabled or disabled using specific commands ('SET GLOBAL tidb_gc_enable=TRUE'/'FALSE') and its status verified through 'SELECT @@global.tidb_gc_enable'.

Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 196, "id": "ef31a0ec-1802-41ba-ba72-8b3761add834"}}

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format.

Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```).

Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format.

It also handles client connections and returns errors and warnings via the MySQL server protocol.\\n\\nThe server includes improvements such as Proxy Protocol support, enhanced monitoring metrics and logs, configuration file validation, TiDB parameter information via HTTP API, batch mode Lock resolution for faster garbage collection, multi-threaded garbage collection, and TLS support. It can be connected to via JDBC by TiSpark and optionally verified using a trusted certificate.\\n\\nEach TiDB server maintains its own cache of AUTO_INCREMENT values, allocated in batches (default 30,000). Interleaved cache requests across multiple servers can cause gaps in the sequence. Restarting a server clears its AUTO_INCREMENT cache, potentially leading to value exhaustion and loss of client error summaries stored in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CLIENT_ERRORS_SUMMARY_GLOBAL`.\\n\\nThe TiDB server has undergone several improvements and fixes, including faster request failures, added virtual tables for profiling, fixed issues with the `kill` command for pessimistic locking, removed unnecessary rollbacks for single-key transactions, panic fixes for empty responses during Region splitting, reduced backoff on PessimisticLock errors, and modified configuration check behavior to print warnings for unrecognized options.'}, {'id': 50082, 'name': 'VERSION()', 'description': 'The `VERSION()` function returns the TiDB version in a format compatible with MySQL.'}, {'id': 40109, 'name': 'Long-Term Support (LTS) Releases', 'description': 'LTS releases of TiDB are released approximately every six months and provide long-term support, including bug fixes and security vulnerability fixes.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```).

Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```).

Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```).

Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue.

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue.

Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 530, "id": "0b58dd7e-97d2-42b7-81ef-629c535556c7"}}

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```).

Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue.

Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 531, "id": "00285472-0333-4451-bf7a-d3c4cc079717"}}

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 532, "id": "00285472-0333-4451-bf7a-d3c4cc079717"}}

Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided knowledge graph data to identify and describe specific issues according to the defined quality objectives and issue types below. Your goal is to facilitate targeted quality improvements while preserving the graph's knowledge integrity.\n\n# Quality Objectives\n\nA high-quality knowledge graph should be:\n\n- **Non-redundant**: Contains unique entities and relationships, avoiding duplication of the same real-world concept or connection.\n- **Coherent**: Entities and relationships form a logical, consistent, and understandable structure representing the domain.\n- **Precise**: Entities and relationships have clear, unambiguous definitions and descriptions, accurately representing specific concepts and connections.\n- **Factually accurate**: All represented knowledge correctly reflects the real world or the intended domain scope.\n- **Efficiently connected**: Features optimal pathways between related entities, avoiding unnecessary or misleading connections while ensuring essential links exist.\n\n\n# Key Issues to Address\n\n1. **Redundant Entities**(redundancy_entity):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct entity entries represent the exact same real-world entity or concept (identical in type and instance).\n  - Identification: Look for highly similar names, aliases, and descriptions that clearly refer to the same thing without meaningful distinction.\n  - Exclusion: Do not flag entities as redundant if they represent different levels in a clear hierarchy (e.g., \"Artificial Intelligence\" vs. \"Machine Learning\") or distinct concepts that happen to be related (e.g., \"Company A\" vs. \"CEO of Company A\").\n\n2. **Redundant Relationships**(redundancy_relationship):\n\n  - Definition: Two or more distinct relationship entries connect the same pair of source and target entities (or entities identified as redundant duplicates) with the same semantic meaning.\n  - Identification: Look for identical or near-identical source/target entity pairs and relationship types/descriptions that convey the exact same connection. Minor variations in phrasing that don't change the core meaning should still be considered redundant.\n  - Example:\n    - Redundant: User â†’ Purchased â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Ordered â†’ Product.\n    - Non-redundant: User â†’ Purchased in 2023 â†’ Product and Customer â†’ Purchased 2024 â†’ Product.\n  - Note: Overlap in descriptive text between an entity and a relationship connected to it is generally acceptable for context and should not, by itself, trigger redundancy.\n\n\n3. **Entity Quality Issues**(entity_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single entity's definition, description, or attributes that significantly hinder its clarity, accuracy, or usability. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Inconsistent Claims: Contains attributes or information that directly contradict each other (e.g., having mutually exclusive status flags like Status: Active and Status: Deleted). This points to a factual impossibility within the entity's representation.\n    - Meaningless or Fundamentally Vague Description: The description is so generic, placeholder-like, or nonsensical that it provides no usable information to define or distinguish the entity (e.g., \"An item\", \"Data entry\", \"See notes\", \"Used for system processes\" without any specifics). The description fails its basic purpose.\n    - Ambiguous Definition/Description: The provided name, description, or key attributes are described in a way that could plausibly refer to multiple distinct real-world concepts or entities, lacking the necessary specificity for unambiguous identification within the graph's context (e.g., An entity named \"System\" with description \"Manages data processing\" in a graph with multiple such systems).\n\n4. **Relationship Quality Issues**(relationship_quality_issue):\n\n  - Definition: Fundamental flaws within a single relationship's definition or description that obscure its purpose, meaning, or the nature of the connection between the source and target entities. This is about core problems, not merely lacking detail.\n\n  - Subtypes:\n\n    - Contradictory Definitions: Conflicting attributes or logic.\n    - Fundamentally Unclear or Ambiguous Meaning: The relationship type or description is so vague, generic, or poorly defined that the nature of the connection between the source and target cannot be reliably understood. It fails to convey a specific semantic meaning. (e.g., `System A -- affects --> System B` without any context of how). This covers cases where the essential meaning is missing, making the relationship definition practically useless or open to multiple interpretations.\n    - **Explicit Exclusions (Important!)**:\n        * **Do NOT flag as a quality issue** solely because a description could be more detailed or comprehensive. The focus must remain on whether the *existing* definition is fundamentally flawed (contradictory, ambiguous, unclear).\n\n# Output Format\n\nYour analysis output must strictly adhere to the following format. Begin with a <think> section detailing your reasoning process for each identified issue in the knowledge graph. Follow this with a JSON array containing the list of issues as your final answer.\n\n1. `<think>` Block: Include all your detailed analysis, reasoning steps, and reflections that led to identifying (or not identifying) each potential issue. Explain why something meets the criteria for a specific issue type.\n2.  Final answer: Present a list of identified issues surrounded by ```json and ``` markers. This list must be formatted as a JSON array and must be placed at the very end of your response. Only this JSON array will be parsed as your final answer. If no issues are found after thorough analysis, provide an empty JSON array (i.e., ```json[]```). Each identified problem must be represented as a JSON object within the array with the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\", // Must be one of: \"low\", \"moderate\", \"high\", \"very_high\"\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\", // Must be one of: \"redundancy_entity\", \"redundancy_relationship\", \"entity_quality_issue\", \"relationship_quality_issue\"\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...] // List of relevant entity or relationship IDs\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n## `affected_ids` Specification (Crucial!)\n\nThe content and format of the `affected_ids` field depend strictly on the `issue_type` and must contain IDs present in the graph:\n\n- `redundancy_entity`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all entities identified as redundant duplicates of each other (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[entity_id1, entity_id2, entity_id3]`\n- `redundancy_relationship`: `affected_ids` must contain the IDs of all relationships identified as redundant duplicates connecting the same entities with the same meaning (minimum of two IDs). Example: `[relationship_id1, relationship_id2]`\n- `entity_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one entity ID, the ID of the entity exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[entity_id_with_issue]`\n- `relationship_quality_issue`: `affected_ids` must contain exactly one relationship ID, the ID of the relationship exhibiting the quality issue. Example: `[relationship_id_with_issue]`\n\n## Example\n\n<think>\nyour detailed reasoning trajectories for graph here\n</think>\n\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"reasoning\": \"Provide a concise summary of your analysis from the <think> section that justifies identifying this specific issue.\",\n    \"confidence\": \"high\",\n    \"issue_type\": \"entity_quality_issue\",\n    \"affected_ids\": [id1, id2, ...]\n  },\n  // Additional issues...\n]\n```\n\n**Important**: Adhere strictly to these definitions and formats. Take sufficient time to analyze the graph data thoroughly against these principles before generating the output. Ensure your reasoning is sound and clearly connected to the specific issue criteria.\n\nNow, Please take more time to think and be comprehensive in your issue, ensure your output is valid, complete, and follows the required structure exactly.", "type": {"index": 533, "id": "00285472-0333-4451-bf7a-d3c4cc079717"}}
